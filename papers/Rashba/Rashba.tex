\chapter{Charge order and spin-momentum locking in high spin-orbit coupled ferroelectrics}
\section{Introduction}
% Bulk ferroelectrics with large atomic spin-orbit coupling allow for electric control of spin-polarized states~\cite{DiSante2013,Ishizaka2011,Kim2014, Liebmann2016, Krempasky2015SurfaceSemiconductor}, allowing for the switching of the spin texture by an externally applied electric field. 
% The underlying mechanism is, however, not well understood.
The research area of spintronics aims to supersede electronics by using spins instead of charges for information processing and storage. %\sa{https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-070909-104123} 
Many possible devices that utilize both charge and spin degrees of freedom of carriers have been theorized. Examples are the spin field-effect transistors (spin-FET)\cite{Datta1990}, storage devices which utilize spin-current and associated spin-transfer torque to efficiently manipulate magnetic domains \cite{Kent2015,Jungwirth2016}. In spite of fundamental interest and potential for applications, the actual realization of these devices has been rather elusive. One of the main culprits for the limited success to date is that the devices require very granular, ideally electric, control of the spin, which is impeded by widely separated energy scales and weak coupling between magnetic and structural degrees of freedom. One class of materials that allow for such electric control of spin-polarized states are the ferroelectric semiconductors with large atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) \cite{DiSante2013,Ishizaka2011,Kim2014}. The underlying mechanism is a coupling between the spin-polarized states and the ferroelectric polarization of the material that makes it possible to switch the ferroelectric polarization and in turn the polarization of the spin by the external electric field. The effect has been confirmed both experimentally \cite{Ishizaka2011,Liebmann2016,Krempasky2015SurfaceSemiconductor}, and through ab initio density functional theory (DFT) simulations \cite{DiSante2013}. 

\section{Rashba-Bychkov Effect}
%############################ NEW ############################
The first effect that springs to mind bearing the signatures of the above description is the Rashba effect, first theorised in the seminal 1959 paper by Rashba and Bychkov \cite{Rashba1959SymmetryAr}. This effect is a text book case where the breaking of a symmetry, in this case inversion symmetry, leads to previously degenerate states becoming nondegenerate with a definite value of the parameter describing the symmetry. In the case of the Rashba-effect, the absence of inversion symmetry leads to a breaking of the up-down symmetry of the spin of bloch functions, leading to states with definite spin polarization. These could then in turn theoretically be used in spintronics applications.
We will first describe how the effect was first derived and then discuss the issues with explaining the observed spin-splitting of bloch wavefunctions in bulk ferroelectrics, and give a hint why the largest spin-polarizing effect might actually be coming from a completely different origin. 

The standard derivation starts from an expansion of the electron part of the fully relativistic Dirac-equation up to second order in $1/c$ where $c$ is the speed of light \cite{Rashba1959SymmetryAr}, in the absense of an external magnetic field:

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{H} \psi = \left[\frac{\bm{p}^2}{2m} - e V - \frac{e \hbar}{4m^2c^2}(\bm{\sigma}\cdot[\bm{\nabla}V \times \bm{p}]) - \frac{\hbar^2}{8m^2c^2} \Delta V - \frac{\bm{p}^4}{8m^3c^2}\right]\psi = E\psi
\end{equation}

where $\psi$ is a two component spinor, V denotes the electric potential, $\bm{\sigma}$ a vector of Pauli-matrices $(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)$, $m$ and $e$ the electron mass and charge respectively, and $\bm{p}$ the canonical momentum. The first two terms are the nonrelativistic part of the Hamiltonian, the third represents the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the fourth is known as the Darwin effect and the fifth is the relativistic correction to the effective electron mass. For the further discussion, we focus on the first three terms.

The next step is to apply the Hamiltonian to Bloch spinor wavefunctions $\psi_n(\bm{k}, \bm{r}) = u_n(\bm{k}, \bm{r})e^{i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{r}}$, where $u_n$ denotes the cell-periodic part, and $n$ is the band index. This leads to an eigenvalue equation for $u_n(\bm{k}, \bm{r})$

\begin{align}
	E_n u_n(\bm{k}, \bm{r}) =& \left(V_0 + V_1  -  (V_2 + V_3) \right) u_n(\bm{k}, \bm{r}) \\
	V_0 =& \frac{p^2}{2m} - eV + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \\
	V_1 =& \hbar\frac{\bm{k}\cdot\bm{p}}{m} \\
	V_2 =& \frac{e \hbar^2}{4m^2c^2} \bm{\sigma} \cdot ( \bm{\nabla}V \times \bm{k}) \\
	V_3 =& \frac{e \hbar}{4m^2c^2} \bm{\sigma} \cdot ( \bm{\nabla}V \times \bm{p})
\end{align}
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

In the following we assume that this equation can be solved for a time reversal symmetric point $\bm{k}_0$ in the first BZ, where the spin-up and spin-down part of the spinor are necessarily degenerate, and proceed following standard $\bm{k}\cdot\bm{p}$ theory to perform an expansion around this k-point. Since including the relativistic terms and nonzero $\bm{k}$ will lead to spin up-down symmetry breaking, we will denote the down spin state as $\Ket{u_n^\downarrow}$ and up spin state as $\Ket{u_n^\uparrow}$ at $\bm{k} = \bm{k}_0$. We only investigate terms in the expansion that are linear in $\bm{k}$, since that's the part of the energy dispersion that we are seeking to explain. We again keep terms up to second order in $(1/c)^{-1}$.
Without loss of generality we can take $\bm{k}_0 = 0$ and $E_0 = 0$.

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:kp_expansion}
	E_n^{\sigma_1}(\bm{k}) =& - \Bra{u_n^{\sigma_1}} V_2 \Ket{u_n^{\sigma_1}} + \\
		& \sum_{m,\sigma_2=\uparrow,\downarrow}\frac{\Bra{u_n^{\sigma_1}} V_1 \Ket{u_m^{\sigma_2}}\Bra{u_m^{\sigma_2}} V_3 \Ket{u_n^{\sigma_1}} + h.c.}{E_m^{\sigma_2} - E_n^{\sigma_1}},
\end{align}

where the sum over $m, \sigma_2$ includes all states which are not equal to $n, \sigma_1$. 

These two terms are of similar order of magnitude in small parameters $c^{-2}$ and $\bm{k}$, but have different behavior with respect to the symmetries of the states, and different origins with respect to the ferroelectricity. The first term can be seen as a direct result of the electric field resulting from the ferroelecticity, i.e. $\nabla V$ there should be understood as the uniform internal electric field, whereas in the second term the $\nabla V$ should be understood as the potential which causes atomic spin-orbit coupling. This means that it is important that the orbitals $u_n$, and $u_m$ in the second term originate from an atom with strong spin-orbit coupling. The reason why this term only leads to a non-zero contribution when inversion is broken can be understood by looking at the required symmetries of orbitals $u_n, u_m$, as was shown by [Blugel paper]. Since $\bm{p}$ is odd in spatial coordinates, $\bm{k} \cdot \bm{p}$ is only non-zero when one of the orbitals is odd with respect to a spatial direction and the other even. One example could be a $p_y$ orbital and a $s$-$pz$ hybdridized one, which would be created by the ferroelectricity with electric polarization along the $z$-axis (add drawing? add hopping matrix?).

With regards to the size of the effect, the first term usually results in a tiny splitting, due to the tiny prefactor ($~10^{-6}$) and small $\bm{k}$ value. The second term can be larger, because atomic SOC can be large for heavier atoms. There is, however, another possible source of spin splitting, originating from the so-called orbital Rashba effect (ORE).

\section{Orbital Rashba Effect}
Contrary to the relativistic effect, this one originates from electrostatic considerations. Namely, it can be shown that Bloch functions with nonzero orbital angular momentum have nonzero dipoles. This leads to two seperate effects, firstly, when spin orbit coupling is included, OAM is unquenched at the high symmetry k-points, and as will be shown below, this leads to a correction to the band dispersion that varies linearly with $\bm{k}$. Secondly, this causes a linear variation of the OAM of the Bloch functions as one moves away from the high-symmetry point. If one then includes $\bm{l}\cdot\bm{\sigma}$ this linear $l$ will lead to an energy contribution with either positive or negative slope.
To understand this contribution, we first need to understand the behavior of the orbital angular momentum of the Bloch functions in reciprocal space. This has been first described by Park et al \cite{Park2011}, and we will give a short derivation here.

The crux is that Bloch functions with periodic part $u_n(\bm{k},\bm{r})$ that have non-zero orbital angular momentum (OAM) create inter unit cell dipoles, which couple to the uniform electric field caused by the polarization. This will thus lead to the creation of orbitals with OAM away from high symmetry points, if symmetries allow for it and ferroelectricity is present. This effect is purely electrostatic and thus doesn't come with small prefectors like the first term in \ref{qe:kp_expansion}.

\subsection{Tight-Binding model}
Due to the breaking of inversion symmetry there are extra allowed hopping terms between unit cells, on top of the usual ones from overlap integrals. These terms originate from the energy $H_{isb} = e (\bm{d}\cdot \bm{E})$, i.e. electric dipole moments coupling to the electric field. In the following we study a toy 2D square layer with one atom per unit cell and $s$, $p$ orbitals, where the field is chosen perpendicular to the 2D layer along the $z$ direction. Assuming Wannier functions $p_\alpha(\bm{r},\bm{R}) = \alpha e^{-|\bm{r}-\bm{R}|^2}$, we can write down the dipole matrix terms between the central unit cell and one shifted by $\bm{R}=\bm{n}a, \bm{n}=(n_x,n_y)$ as follows:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:dipole}
	\hat{d}_z(\bm{n}) =& ae^{-\frac{a^2|\bm{n}|^2}{2}}\frac{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}}{16\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{matrix}0&0&0&2\\\\0&0&0&n_x\\\\0&0&0&n_y\\\\2&n_x&n_y&0\end{matrix}\right)\\
	=&d_z^0(\bm{n})\hat{d}^1_z(\bm{n}),
	% d_z(\bm{R}) = ae^{-\frac{|\bm{R}|^2}{2}}\frac{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}}{16\sqrt{2}}(2,n_x,n_y,0),
\end{align}
where the indices run through $s$, $p_{x,y,z}$. Using these Wannier functions we can write down the dipoles of Bloch functions as,
\begin{align}
	d_z(\bm{k}) &= \sum_{\bm{n}} e^{i \bm{k}\cdot \bm{n}}d_z(\bm{n})\\
	&=\sum_{\bm{n}}i \sin(\bm{k}\cdot\bm{n}) d_z(\bm{n})
\end{align}
writing $\bm{k}$ in terms of crystalline coordinates, and we kept only the $\sin(\bm{k}\cdot\bm{n})$ part of the exponent since the $\cos(\bm{k}\cdot\bm{n})$ part is $0$ due to the fact that it is even in the sum over $\bm{n} = \{-\infty, \infty\}$, whereas $d_z(\bm{n})$ is odd. If we then assume that at $k=0$ the Bloch functions are formed purely from these $s$,$p_{x,y,z}$ Wannier functions: $\Ket{\alpha(\bm{k}=\bm{0})} = \sum_{\bm{n}} \Ket{\alpha(\bm{n})}$, we can write down a perturbation theory for small $\bm{k}$ in the spirit of the usual $\bm{k}\cdot\bm{p}$ theory,
\begin{align}
	\Ket{\alpha(\bm{k})}&=\Ket{\alpha} + \sum_{\beta} \frac{\Bra{\alpha} H_0(\bm{k}) + H_{isb}(\bm{k}) \Ket{\beta}}{E_{\beta} - E_{\alpha}} \Ket{\beta}\\
	&=\Ket{\alpha} + \sum_{\beta} \frac{\Bra{\alpha} H_0(\bm{k}) + e E_z d_z(\bm{k}) \Ket{\beta}}{E_{\beta} - E_{\alpha}} \Ket{\beta}.
\end{align}
The effect of $H_{isb}$ is to mix $p_{x,y}$ and $p_z$ orbitals, e.g. if $\Ket{\alpha} = p_x$ we get that
\begin{align}
	\Ket{\alpha(\bm{k})} &= \Ket{p_x} + i \frac{e E_z \sum_{\bm{n}} \sin(k_x n_x)n_x d_z^0(\bm{n})}{E_{p_z} - E_{p_x}} \Ket{p_z}\\
	&=\Ket{p_x} + i c(k_x) \Ket{p_z}.
\end{align}
With $l_y = -i\hbar(z \partial_x - x \partial_z )$ we get that
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:oam_from_k}
	\Bra{\alpha(\bm{k})} l_y \Ket{\alpha(\bm{k})} = c(k_x) = k_x \frac{e E_z \sum_{\bm{n}} n_x^2d_z^0(\bm{n})}{E_{p_z} - E_{p_x}}
\end{equation}
\lp{normalization!!}
A similar term exists for $l_x$, but with the opposite sign. If the atomic spin-orbit coupling, $\lambda \bm{l}\cdot\bm{\sigma}$, is then taken into account, we get to a contribution to the energy dispersion $\varepsilon(\bm{k}) \propto E_z (k_x \sigma_y - k_y \sigma_x)$ which has exactly the form of a Rashba splitting. 
This shows that the inversion symmetry breaking term will lead to a linear variation of the orbital angular momentum. When the orbitals originate from an atom with non-negligible atomic spin-orbit coupling , this linear variation of the OAM will lead to a contribution to the dispersion that varies linearly with $\bm{k}$, either upwards or downwards depending on the sign of $\sigma$. Except for the atomic spin-orbit coupling, which can be large, this effect is purely based around electrostatic considerations and thus does not suffer from the same minuscule prefactor as the purely relativistic Rashba effect.

This assumes that the states at the high symmetry point ($|k|=0$) have a fully quenched OAM, however, when spin-orbit coupling is included, this is only partially true. Due to the energy contribution from $H_{soc}$ the material can gain by creating orbitals that have $\bm{j} = \bm{l} + \bm{\sigma}$. Similar to the above derivation, we can look at a small-$k$ expansion for orbitals that have nonzero OAM.

We can write in general that
\begin{equation}
	\Bra{\alpha} \hat{l}_{\gamma} \Ket{\beta} = i \epsilon_{\alpha \beta \gamma} c^*_\alpha c_\beta
\end{equation}
when $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ designate $p_{x,y,z}$. This means that there has to be at least some admixing of multiple $p$-orbitals to get nonzero OAM. This leads to the following expansion of the Bloch functions around the high-symmetry $|k|=0$ point:
\begin{align}
	\Ket{\psi_n(\bm{k})} =& \sum_{\bm{n},\alpha} c_\alpha(\bm{k}) e^{i \bm{k}\cdot\bm{n}}\Ket{\alpha(\bm{n})}\\
	=& \sum_{\bm{n},\alpha} \left(c_\alpha(0) + \bm{k}\left.\frac{\partial c_\alpha(\bm{k})}{\partial_k}\right\rvert_{\bm{k}=0} \right)\left(1 + i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{n}\right)\Ket{\alpha(\bm{n})} .
\end{align}
If we then calculate the linear-with-k varying dipole moment of these Bloch functions, we can recognize the contribution coming from the second term in the $c$ expansion together with the first term in the $e$ expansion as the previously discussed contribution. We can, however, also combine the first term in the $c$ expansion with the second in the $e$ expansion. If we single out this contribution to $d_z(\bm{k})$ we get
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:d_z_from_OAM}
	d_z(\bm{k}) =&  i\sum_{\bm{n},\alpha,\beta} c_\alpha^*(0)c_\beta(0)\bm{k}\cdot\bm{n}\Bra{\alpha(\bm{0})} \hat{d}_z \Ket{\beta(\bm{n})}\\
	=&i\sum_{\bm{n}} d^0_z(\bm{n}) (c^*_x(0)c_z(0)k_x n_x^2 + c^*_y(0)c_z(0) k_y n_y^2) \\
	=&\sum_{\bm{n}} d^0_z(\bm{n}) (l_x(0)k_y n_y^2-l_y(0) k_x n_x^2).
\end{align}
\lp{normalization!!}
These expressions show us that, together with $H_{soc} = \lambda \bm{l}\cdot\bm{\sigma}$ and $H_{isb} = e E_z d_z$, an additional Rashba-like term will appear in the energy dispersion\lp{maybe a little more explanation is warranted here}.

With the understanding that one can find Rashba like dispersions, coming not from the usually considered purely relativistic, but also from electrostatic means, we can look at an example situation where this leads to a gigantic spin-splitting in a bulk material, namely Germanium Telluride (GeTe).

\end{figure}
\section{Overview: Germanium Telluride}
The space group of GeTe is R$3m$ (\#160 in International Tables), with ferroelectric polarization along the threefold rotation $z$-axis caused by an off-centering of the central Te atom \cite{Rabe1987} as displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:eigvalsdos}-(a). The valence and conduction bands are formed mostly by $s$ and $p$ orbitals from Te and Ge, respectively. This, together with the large spin-splitting in the vicinity of the $Z$ point \cite{DiSante2013} as observed from the bandstructure in Fig. \ref{fig:eigvalsdos}-(b), lends it as a perfect test-case of the above described mechanisms. Moreover, since it's a bulk material, we can rule out the possibility that the relativistic Rashba effects results in a contribution from the existence of possible large potential gradients at a surface. The band structure,  presents a distinct large linear spin splitting around the $Z$ point, resembling the well known Rashba effect. Due to time reversal symmetry, no spin-splitting is only present observed along the $Z-A$ and $Z-U$ paths, not the $Z-\Gamma$ path.
The density of states (DOS), displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:eigvalsdos}-(c), confirms the orbital character of the bands, aluded to earlier.
% The valence bands are comprised mostly of Te 5p orbitals, whereas the conduction bands are mostly formed by Ge 4p orbitals. This orbital character of valence and conduction bands, together with the stronger atomic SOC on Te atom, results in a more pronounced spin splitting in the valence bands. We will focus on the first three valence bands, the top one of which mainly has $p_z$ character whereas the two lower bands, which are degenerate at the $Z$-point, are formed by $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals. The crystal field splitting between bands of $p_z$ and $p_{x,y}$ characters results from the distortion of the ideal Te-Ge$_6$ octahedron.

% Wannier representation allows us to elucidate the $k$-dependent electric dipole moment arising due to interference of the atomic orbitals on the neighboring sites \cite{Marzari2012MaximallyApplications}. In order to obtain the effective Hamiltonian, we write the Bloch functions as linear combinations of the Wannier functions that describe the bands of interest: $$\psi_{\bm{k}}(\bm{r})=\sum_{\alpha,\bm{R}} c_\alpha(\bm{k}) w_\alpha(\bm{r}-\bm{R})e^{i\bm{k}\bm{R}},$$ where the Wannier functions $w_\alpha(r)$ are chosen to be real and $\bm{R}$ denote the unit cell in which the orbital is centered.

% In the case of GeTe the electric polarization is along the $z$ direction, making it sufficient to focus on the corresponding dipole moment
% \begin{align}
% d_z(\bm{k}) &=e\sum_{\alpha,\beta,\bm{R}}A_{\alpha,\beta}(\bm{k})e^{i\bm{k}.\bm{R}} \, \mathcal{Z}_{\alpha,\beta}^{\bm{R}} \\
% A_{\alpha,\beta}(\bm{k}) &= c_{\alpha}^*(\bm{k}) c_\beta(\bm{k}) \\
% \mathcal{Z}_{\alpha,\beta}^{\bm{R}} &= \int d\bm{r}   w_{\alpha}(\bm{r})w_\beta(\bm{r}-\bm{R}) z. \label{eq:Znn}
% \end{align}
% Expanding each term around $k_Z$, and keeping contributions up to first order in $\bm{k}^r = (k_Z - \bm{k})$, one obtains
% \begin{align}\label{eq:dip}
% d_z(\bm{k}) =e\sum_{\alpha,\beta,\bm{R}} &\left(A_{\alpha,\beta}(Z) + \bm{k}^r \left.\frac{\partial A_{\alpha,\beta}(\bm{k}) }{\partial \bm{k}}\right\rvert_{\bm{k}=Z}\right) \times \nonumber \\ 
% &(1 + i\bm{k}^r \cdot \bm{R}) \mathcal{Z}_{\alpha,\beta}^{\bm{R}}.
% \end{align}
% The term that combines the first order variation of $A_{\alpha,\beta}(\bm{k})$ with the zeroth order term from the exponent leads to a nonzero contribution only if $w_\alpha, w_\beta = s, p_z$ in the same unit cell ($\bm{R}=0$).
% This is the charge asymmetry that comes from $s$-$p_z$ hybridization and was previously considered in the context of giant spin splitting at surfaces in Refs.~\citenum{Petersen2000SimpleStates,Go2016SurfacePhysics} and for bulk perovskites in Ref.~\citenum{Kim2014}.
% The new terms that we consider here combine the zeroth and first order contributions to $A_{\alpha,\beta}(\bm{k})$ with the first order $i\bm{k}^r \cdot \bm{R}$ term.
% Using indices $1,2,3$ to denote $p_x, p_y, p_z$ Wannier functions one obtains the following relation between the Bloch function coefficients and the OAM: $l_k(\bm{k}) = -i \epsilon_{ijk} A_{ij}$.%\sa{only for pure $p_x$ etc. functions}

Black and blue arrows denote the complex phases of wavefunctions in neighboring unit cells, where the red arrow shows the resulting complex amplitude of the total Bloch function due to interference of the orbitals. The overlapping orbitals where spaced apart for visual clarity.}
% \end{figure}
% Upon closer inspection of the overlap dipole, $\mathcal{Z}_{\alpha,\beta}^{\bm{R}}$, one concludes that for $d_z$ to be nonzero, at least one of the orbitals $\alpha,\beta$ needs to be the $p_z$ orbital and the shift-vector $\bm{R}$ has to have a component along the second orbital ($p_x$ or $p_y$). This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:overlapdip}(a). 
% Another requirement for this term to be nonzero is that the orbitals have odd parity, such as $p$ and $f$. This is highlighted in Fig.~\ref{fig:overlaparrows}. If they have even parity (as is the case for the $d$ orbitals displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:overlapdip}(b) and ~\ref{fig:overlaparrows}(b)), the overlap dipoles from neighboring unit cells will cancel. 
% Filling this into Eq.~(\ref{eq:dip}) and summing over the nearest neighbor unit cells ($\bm{R} = \pm 1$), we arrive at
% \begin{align}\label{eq:dipfinal}
%     d_z(\bm{k}) &= 4e \left(l_x(Z) + \bm{k}^r \left.\frac{\partial l_x(\bm{k}) }{\partial \bm{k}}\right\rvert_{\bm{k}=Z}\right) k^r_yR_y \mathcal{Z}_{y,z}^{R_y}\nonumber \\
%     &  - 4e\left(l_y(Z) + \bm{k}^r \left.\frac{\partial l_y(\bm{k}) }{\partial \bm{k}}\right\rvert_{\bm{k}=Z}\right) k^r_xR_x \mathcal{Z}_{x,z}^{R_x}.
% \end{align}
% The coupling of the electric dipole moment with an external electric field, or in the case of GeTe, with the electric polarization, leads to a contribution to the Hamiltonian of the form:
% \begin{equation}\label{HOR}
%     \mathcal{H}_{OR} \propto \bm{l} \cdot ( \bm{k} \times \bm{E})
% \end{equation}
% The terms with $l_{x,y}(Z)$ lead to a linear $k$-dependence of the band energy if the atomic SOC partially unquenches the OAM.
% The second term leads to energy contribution, quadratic in $k$, but results in a linear variation of the OAM even in the absence of SOC. This linear variation of the OAM will then couple to $\bm{\sigma}$ [also referred to as spin angular momentum (SAM)] through the atomic SOC, leading to the linear spin splitting.

% The energy dispersion close to the $Z$ point can thus be modeled by
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:hami}
% \epsilon(\bm{k}) = \epsilon(Z) + \lambda_{so} \bm{l}\cdot \bm{\sigma} + c_1 \bm{l} \cdot ( \bm{k} \times \bm{E})+ c_2 l_z^2,
% \end{equation}
% where $\epsilon(Z)$ contains a constant band shift, while the term with $\lambda$ is the atomic spin-orbit coupling, and the latter terms represent the contribution due to the threefold symmetric crystal field for $l=1$.
% To explicitly show how the linear variation of the OAM arises from the terms in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dipfinal}), we performed a $k\cdot p$-expansion of the first valence band which leads to following expressions for the OAM around $k=Z$:
% \begin{align}\label{eq:OAM}
% l_x &= -\frac{\lambda_{so}\sigma_x - c_1 E_z k_y}{c_2} \\
% l_y &= -\frac{\lambda_{so}\sigma_y + c_1 E_z k_x}{c_2},\nonumber
% \end{align}
% where we only included terms with the $E_z$ component.

\section{Methods}
To analyze and confirm the earlier made statements and observations, we performed ab-initio DFT calculations using the Quantum-Espresso software package\cite{Giannozzi2009}. Both non- and fully-relativistic calculations were performed to confirm the existence of the linear varying OAM even when spin-orbit is not included. Both calculations were performed using ONCVPSP pseudopotentials, with energy cutoffs of 40 Ry for the energy cutoff, and 160Ry for the density cutoff. The reciprocal space was sampled using a 10x10x10 and 6x6x6 Monkhorst-Pack grid for the self-consistent and non-self-consistent calculations, respectively, using an energy convergence threshold of $10^{-7}$. Afterwards we used the Wannier90 \cite{Mostofi2014AnFunctions} package to perform the Wannierization, using atomic $s$ and $p$-orbitals on both Ge and Te. This provides us with the tools to analyse the localized properties of the Bloch functions such as the dipole moment and OAM.

\end{figure}
The bands we will focus on most are the three topmost valence bands. As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:eigvalsdos}-(a), these bands have the largest spin-splitting, giving already a hint that as shown above, the atomic SOC is an important part, since it's bigger on Te, where the orbitals comprising these bands originate from. If one were to fit the dispersion from the topmost valence band to the form of the Rashba Hamiltonian \cite{Rashba1959SymmetryAr, Lifshitz1982CourseTheory},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:relrashba}
\mathcal{H}_R=\alpha_R (\bm{k} \times \bm{E})\cdot \bm{\sigma}, \quad \alpha_R=\frac{e\hbar^2}{2m^2c^2},
\end{equation}
it would result in an abnormally large $\alpha_R\approx 30.7$~eV\.\angstrom \cite{DiSante2013}, while, as discussed before, a more realistic prefactor would be $\alpha_R=10^{-6}$~eV in the purely relativistic case inside the vacuum. This is even more abnormal considering the fact that this is a bulk material, and that it is known that proper ferroelectrics have zero polarization in open boundary conditions because the depolarizing fields are not screened. Moreover, in the periodic boundary conditions utilized by DFT, the potential mimics short circuit boundary conditions \cite{Meyer2008AbFields}, $\bm E=0$, which results in zero contribution from Eq. \ref{eq:relrashba}. 

The last issue with the purely relativistic explanation, which has been confirmed experimentally\cite{Krempasky2015SurfaceSemiconductor}, lies in the orientation of the spin polarization of the split bands. According to Eq. \ref{eq:relrashba}, they should all be lined up. However, as has been shown and will be confirmed by our results below, the orientation depends on the character of the band, more specifically the value of the total angular momentum $j$. 

% We performed ab initio calculations to study how the discussed effects manifest themselves in GeTe. To arrive at the desired basis of Wannier functions and tight-binding Hamiltonian, we first performed a collinear DFT calculation using the Quantum-Espresso package \cite{Giannozzi2009}, followed by WANNIER90 \cite{Mostofi2014AnFunctions}. For the DFT calculation we used a 10x10x10 Monkhorst-Pack k-grid, as well as an energy convergence threshold of $10^{-8}$~Ry. In the Wannierization step the gauge freedom of Wannier functions was exploited to arrive at a set of basis functions which are localized \cite{Marzari2012MaximallyApplications}, and resemble closely the atomic orbitals (spherical harmonics). Afterwards we added atomic SOC in the form $\lambda_{so} \bm{l} \cdot \bm{\sigma}$ using the muffin-tin approximation, with $\lambda_{so}$ for both atoms used as fitting parameters. Using this basis and Hamiltonian, we can the calculate the observables of interest, namely the OAM around Te and the dipole of the Bloch functions. 
\section{Results and Discussion}
The dispersion, OAM and SAM of the first valence band is shown in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:oamvseigvalv}. Confirming our earlier conclusions, we can see that indeed non-zero, linearly varying OAM is formed as we move away from the high-symmetry $Z$-point. Moreover, the OAM is perpendicular to both the $z$-axis and the $k$ vector, as it should be from Eq.\ref{eq:oam_from_k}. This leads e.g. to $l_y=0$ along the $A \to Z$ path, where only $k_y$ is nonzero. When atomic SOC is included in the orange and blue graphs, we see the splitting that results from having the spin oriented either along or opposite to the already linearly varying OAM. The unquenching of the OAM at the $Z$-point when SOC is included is also clearly visible, together with a change in the slope that is associated with the contribution of Eq. \ref{eq:d_z_from_OAM}. This correlation can also be observed in the panel showing the center of mass $\bar{z}=\int_{\textrm{supercell}}z |\psi(k)|^2$ of the Bloch-functions, giving an idea.
Focusing on the topmost valence band, displayed in the left panel of , there are several features that warrant a discussion. The first is that we clearly see the linear variation of the OAM even without SOC, with forms given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:OAM}). Secondly, since only $k_y$ varies along the $A \to Z$ path, it it evident that the OAM along the $y$ axis ($l_y$) vanishes along the entire path. It is only when $k_x$ varies, as the wavevector progresses along the $Z \to U$ path, that we observe a nonvanishing $l_y$. Along this path, the sign of $k_x$ is negative whereas the sign of $k_y$ is positive just as along the $Z-A$ path. This results in a consistent orientation of $l_y$ and $l_x$, given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:OAM}). The third observation is that including atomic SOC is manifestated in the "unquenching" of the OAM. In Fig.~\ref{fig:oamvseigvalv}, as soon as there is an infinitesimal variation of the the wave vector from the time-reversal invariant $Z$-point (where $\bm{l}=0$ due to the symmetry), the unquenching of OAM leads to a nonzero shift in the OAM, with the sign depending on the subband.

Lastly, to correlate the changes in the OAM and the dipole of the Bloch function, we computed the $z$ coordinate of the center of mass , which is proportional to the dipole moment computed around the same reference point. Figure ~\ref{fig:oamvseigvalv} shows the  correlation of the dipole and OAM of the bands, consistent with Eq.~(\ref{eq:dipfinal}), while Fig.~\ref{Fig:diffdens} displays the asymmetric variation of the charge density of the first valence band along the $Z\to A$ path. More specifically, there is a clear development of a nonzero dipole moment around Ge, which couples to the local $E_z$.
These considerations also hold true for the third valence band, as seen from the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:oamvseigvalv}.

In addition to the magnitude of $\alpha_R$,  other important features are dependent on the orbital character of the bands, unlike in the case of the relativistic Rashba effect, as was discussed above. We see that for states with predominant $j=\frac{3}{2}$ or $j=\frac{1}{2}$ character, the SAM is oriented along or opposite to the OAM, respectively. Comparing the orientations of the SAM and OAM, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:textures}, we conclude that close to the $Z$-point, the topmost valence band has mostly $j=\frac{3}{2}$ character, whereas the third mostly $j=\frac{1}{2}$.
Interestingly, the states in the upper third valence band and lower first valence band switch characters when moving further away from the $Z$ point, as seen in the panels (c) and (f) of Fig.~\ref{fig:textures}. This draws attention to the fact that inclusion of Eq.~(\ref{HOR}) breaks threefold symmetry and results in $j$ not being a good quantum number anymore. This causes a highly nontrivial SAM and OAM texture to be present in these two subbands, with both SAM and OAM varying considerably throughout the BZ.
When comparing the spin splitting of the two valence bands, their relative signs are opposite, an effect which cannot be explained by the relativistic Rashba effect [Eq.~(\ref{eq:relrashba})], that leads to the same splittings, regardless of the character of the band. Only terms such as Eq.~(\ref{eq:dipfinal}) can explain this behavior.

%Looking back to Eq.~(\ref{eq:hami}), we can identify three main mechanisms that can result in a large linear spin splitting in the band dispersion.
  %The first is large OAM unquenching effect, resulting in a significant $\bm{l}(Z)$ which couples to $\bm{\sigma}(Z)$, causing a linear variation of the dipole energy through the first term of Eq.~(\ref{eq:dipfinal}). The second is a linear variation of OAM a constant SAM, and the third -- vice versa. 
%In the topmost valence band the linear variations of the dipole and SAM are very small. This suggests that the origin of the giant Rashba-like splitting is the large linear variation of the OAM, caused by the coupling to the electric polarization through the dipole, together with the large atomic SOC which then couples to the nonzero SAM through $\lambda_{so} \bm{l} \cdot \bm{\sigma}$. In the third valence band, however, the variation of the OAM is less than that of the SAM, and the contribution due to the charge asymmetry plays a bigger role, making it hard to assign the splitting to a single contribution. 

\section{Conclusions}

We have explored the microscopic origin of the giant Rashba-like spin splitting in the band structure of bulk ferroelectric GeTe with high atomic SOC. We derived the form of the band dispersion in the Wannier representation, that relates the large spin splitting to the intricate interplay between OAM, atomic SOC, the crystal field and the electric polarization. It turns out that the crucial component, which is not present in the relativistic Rashba effect, is the emergence of a nonzero electric dipole of the Bloch functions due to their OAM. The quantitative analysis based on Wannier functions and atomic-centered approximation confirms this mechanism in GeTe. We find a very good agreement between the proposed band dispersion, Eq.~(\ref{eq:hami}), and the dispersions of the first and third valence bands, where the effect manifests itself most clearly.

Ultimately, the results suggest that (1) large ferroelectric polarization, (2) high atomic SOC, and (3) highly symmetric environment producing little OAM quenching could be the design rules for new materials with strong Rashba-like spin splitting. These materials could enable spintronic devices with the much needed electric control of spin polarization.
