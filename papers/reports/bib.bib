abstract = {The solution of the quantum-mechanical eigenvalue problem is discussed for cases when a series of approximate eigenfunctions is known. If these "unperturbed" states are divided into two classes, a perturbation formula is derived giving the influence of one class of states on the other in the final solution: The formula contains as special cases: (i) the Schr{\"{o}}dinger-Brillouin formula for the eigenvalue of a nondegenerate state, (ii) a new simple formula for treating a class of degenerate states, and (iii) the splitting of the secular equation in cases where the system naturally consists of two independent parts in mutual interaction.},

@article{Giovannetti2008,
abstract = {We show that electronic correlations decimate the intrinsic ferroelectric polarization of multiferroic manganites RMn2O5, where R is a rare earth element. Such is manifest from ab initio band structure computations that account for the Coulomb interactions between the manganese 3d electrons-the root of magnetism in RMn2O5. Including these leads to an amplitude and direction of polarization of HoMn2O5 that agree with experiment. The decimation is caused by a near cancellation of the ionic polarization induced by the lattice and the electronic one due to valence charge redistributions. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Li2014,
abstract = {Electrostriction plays an important role in the electromechanical behavior of ferroelectrics and describes a phenomenon in dielectrics where the strain varies proportional to the square of the electric field/polarization. Perovskite ferroelectrics demonstrating high piezoelectric performance, including BaTiO3, Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3, and relaxor-PbTiO3 materials, have been widely used in various electromechanical devices. To improve the piezoelectric activity of these materials, efforts have been focused on the ferroelectric phase transition regions, including shift the composition to the morphotropic phase boundary or shift polymorphic phase transition to room temperature. However, there is not much room left to further enhance the piezoelectric response in perovskite solid solutions using this approach. With the purpose of exploring alternative approaches, the electrostrictive effect is systematically surveyed in this paper. Initially, the techniques for measuring the electrostrictive effect are given and compared. Second, the origin of electrostriction is discussed. Then, the relationship between the electrostriction and the microstructure and macroscopic properties is surveyed. The electrostrictive properties of ferroelectric materials are investigated with respect to temperature, composition, phase, and orientation. The relationship between electrostriction and piezoelectric activity is discussed in detail for perovskite ferroelectrics to achieve new possibilities for piezoelectric enhancement. Finally, future perspectives for electrostriction studies are proposed. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},
