abstract = {The energy and momentum selectivity of time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is exploited to address the ultrafast dynamics of the antiferromagnetic spin density wave (SDW) transition photoexcited in epitaxial thin films of chromium. We are able to quantitatively extract the evolution of the SDW order parameter $\Delta$ through the ultrafast phase transition and show that $\Delta$ is governed by the transient temperature of the thermalized electron gas, in a mean field description. The complete destruction of SDW order on a sub-100 fs time scale is observed, much faster than for conventional charge density wave materials. Our results reveal that equilibrium concepts for phase transitions such as the order parameter may be utilized even in the strongly nonadiabatic regime of ultrafast photoexcitation.},

abstract = {Symmetry breaking and the emergence of order is one of the most fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics. It leads to a plethora of intriguing ground states found in antiferromagnets, Mott insulators, superconductors, and density-wave systems. Exploiting states of matter far from equilibrium can provide even more striking routes to symmetry-lowered, ordered states. Here, we demonstrate for the case of elemental chromium that moderate ultrafast photo-excitation can transiently enhance the charge-density-wave (CDW) amplitude by up to 30{\%} above its equilibrium value, while strong excitations lead to an oscillating, large-amplitude CDW state that persists above the equilibrium transition temperature. Both effects result from dynamic electron-phonon interactions, providing an efficient mechanism to selectively transform a broad excitation of the electronic order into a well defined, long-lived coherent lattice vibration. This mechanism may be exploited to transiently enhance order parameters in other systems with coupled degrees of freedom.},

@article{Zeiger1992,
abstract = {We report femtosecond time-resolved pump-probe reflection experiments in semimetals and semiconductors that show large-amplitude oscillations with periods characteristic of lattice vibrations. Only A1 modes are detected, although modes with other symmetries are observed with comparable intensity in Raman scattering. We present a theory of the excitation process in this class of materials, which we refer to as displacive excitation of coherent phonons (DECP). In DECP, after excitation by a pump pulse, the electronically excited system rapidly comes to quasiequilibrium in a time short compared to nuclear response times. In materials with A1 vibrational modes, the quasiequilibrium nuclear A1 coordinates are displaced with no change in lattice symmetry, giving rise to a coherent vibration of A1 symmetry about the displaced quasiequilibrium coordinates. One important prediction of the DECP mechanism is the excitation of only modes with A1 symmetry. Furthermore, the oscillations in the reflectivity R are excited with a cos(0t) dependence, where t=0 is the time of arrival of the pump pulse peak, and 0 is the vibrational frequency of the A1 mode. These predictions agree well with our observations in Bi, Sb, Te, and Ti2O3. The fit of the experimental R(t)/R(0) data to the theory is excellent. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Torrontegui2013,
abstract = {Quantum adiabatic processes-that keep constant the populations in the instantaneous eigenbasis of a time-dependent Hamiltonian-are very useful to prepare and manipulate states, but take typically a long time. This is often problematic because decoherence and noise may spoil the desired final state, or because some applications require many repetitions. "Shortcuts to adiabaticity" are alternative fast processes which reproduce the same final populations, or even the same final state, as the adiabatic process in a finite, shorter time. Since adiabatic processes are ubiquitous, the shortcuts span a broad range of applications in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, such as fast transport of ions or neutral atoms, internal population control, and state preparation (for nuclear magnetic resonance or quantum information), cold atom expansions and other manipulations, cooling cycles, wavepacket splitting, and many-body state engineering or correlations microscopy. Shortcuts are also relevant to clarify fundamental questions such as a precise quantification of the third principle of thermodynamics and quantum speed limits. We review different theoretical techniques proposed to engineer the shortcuts, the experimental results, and the prospects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A shortcut to adiabaticity is a driving protocol that reproduces in a short time the same final state that would result from an adiabatic, infinitely slow process. A powerful technique to engineer such shortcuts relies on the use of auxiliary counterdiabatic fields. Determining the explicit form of the required fields has generally proven to be complicated. We present explicit counterdiabatic driving protocols for scale-invariant dynamical processes, which describe, for instance, expansion and transport. To this end, we use the formalism of generating functions and unify previous approaches independently developed in classical and quantum studies. The resulting framework is applied to the design of shortcuts to adiabaticity for a large class of classical and quantum, single-particle, nonlinear, and many-body systems.},

@article{Zhou2017,
abstract = {Adiabatic processes are useful for quantum technologies but, despite their robustness to experimental imperfections, they remain susceptible to decoherence due to their long evolution time. A general strategy termed shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) aims to remedy this vulnerability by designing fast dynamics to reproduce the results of a slow, adiabatic evolution. Here, we implement an STA technique known as superadiabatic transitionless driving (SATD) to speed up stimulated Raman adiabatic passage in a solid-state lambda system. Using the optical transitions to a dissipative excited state in the nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, we demonstrate the accelerated performance of different shortcut trajectories for population transfer and for the initialization and transfer of coherent superpositions. We reveal that SATD protocols exhibit robustness to dissipation and experimental uncertainty, and can be optimized when these effects are present. These results suggest that STA could be effective for controlling a variety of solid-state open quantum systems.},

abstract = {{A comprehensive account is given of the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of chromium (and where appropriate those of its dilute alloys) that relate to its antiferromagnetism. Neutron scattering is treated in great detail, first in the historical introduction, then as an experimental probe of both the magnetic structure and the excitations of the incommensurate spin-density-wave state and (with the assis-tance of x rays{\}} of the concomitant charge-density wave and strain wave. Neutron scattering is considered as a tool to explore not only the disappearance of long-range order with increasing temperature through the growth of excitations as the weak first-order Neel transition is approached, but also the persistence of these spin fluctuations we' ll into the paramagnetic state — processes that are still little understood. The ar-ticle surveys, without mathematical details, model systems designed to reproduce the magnetic and ther-modynamic properties of Cr. The energy-band structure calculations are given a more comprehensive re-view. Special attention is paid to calculations of the wave-vector-dependent susceptibility that reproduce the observed wave vector of the spin-density wave, and to a recent finite-temperature calculation that gives almost the right Neel temperature. The review of Fermi-surface studies emphasizes those designed to relate the spiIi-density wave vector {\{}and its pressure dependence{\}} to the nesting vector of the Fermi sur-face. An account is given of the spectroscopic determination of the energy gap(s), whose theoretical analysis is still unclear, and of experiments aimed at determining physical properties that throw light on the origin of the weak first-order Neel transition. The article describes the use of magnetic anomalies in the elastic moduli to determine the volume dependence of the exchange interaction responsible for antifer-romagnetism in Cr. The experimental features of the spin-Aip transition are reviewed, although a theory of this phenomenon is wanting. The experimental study of microscopic structure by the use of hyperfine-interaction properties is surveyed. An account is given of both experimental and theoretical studies of the surface of Cr and of Cr films and sandwiches. Finally, "technical antiferromagnetism" is discussed: the effect of severe internal strain in producing a commensurate antiferromagnetic state, wave-vector g domains, polarization S domains (for which the experimental evidence is scanty), and ultrasonic attenua-tion as a tool to study them.},
