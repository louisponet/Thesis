@article{Thonhauser2011,
abstract = {In this review article, we survey the relatively new theory of orbital magnetization in solids — often referred to as the "modern theory of orbital magnetization" — and its applications. Surprisingly, while the calculation of the orbital magnetization in finite systems such as atoms and molecules is straight forward, in extended systems or solids it has long eluded calculations owing to the fact that the position operator is ill-defined in such a context. Approaches that overcome this problem were first developed in 2005 and in the first part of this review we present the main ideas reaching from a Wannier function approach to semi-classical and finite-temperature formalisms. In the second part, we describe practical aspects of calculating the orbital magnetization, such as taking k-space derivatives, a formalism for pseudopotentials, a single k-point derivation, a Wannier interpolation scheme, and DFT specific aspects. We then show results of recent calculations on Fe, Co, and Ni. In the last part of this review, we focus on direct applications of the orbital magnetization. In particular, we will review how properties such as the nuclear magnetic resonance shielding tensor and the electron paramagnetic resonance g-tensor can be elegantly calculated in terms of a derivative of the orbital magnetization.},

When this spatial confinement is combined with observations of emergent functional properties, such as polarity in non-polar systems or electrical conductivity in otherwise insulating materials, it becomes clear that domain walls represent new and exciting objects in matter. In this Review, we discuss the exotic polarization profiles that can arise at domain walls with multiple order parameters and the different mechanisms that lead to domain-wall polarity in non-polar ferroelastic materials. The emergence of energetically degenerate variants of the domain walls themselves suggests the existence of interesting quasi-1D topological defects within such walls. We also provide an overview of the general notions that have been postulated as fundamental mechanisms responsible for domain-wall conduction in ferroelectrics. We then discuss the prospect of combining domain walls with transition regions observed at phase boundaries, homo- and heterointerfaces, and other quasi-2D objects, enabling emergent properties beyond those available in today's topological systems.},

@article{Merz1954,
abstract = {The nucleation and growth of ferroelectric domains in barium titanate have been studied as a function of applied electric field and temperature. The optical and electrical measurements were made on thin single-crystal plates normal to c, the polar direction. When the electric field applied along this direction is reversed, new domains with opposite polarization are formed. The manner of growth of these domains is very different from that of domain growth in ferromagnetic materials. The sidewise motion of the 180°side walls (walls between domains with antiparallel polarization) which is common in ferromagnetic crystals is almost never found in barium titanate. Instead its polarization is changed by the formation of very many new anti-parallel domains which are extremely thin (10-4 cm) and appear to grow only in the forward direction. The explanation of this behavior is found in the weak coupling between the dipoles perpendicular to the dipole direction. The wall thickness is small, of the order of one to a few lattice constants; the wall energy in BaTiO3 is of the order of 10 erg/cm2. Electrical pulsing experiments substantiate the optical observations very clearly. Pulsing the samples at different temperatures shows that the nucleation rate of new domains is accelerated at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the growth of the new domains is faster at higher temperatures. Experimental results are presented showing how the switching current and the switching time depend on applied electrical field, on temperature, and on the size of the sample. {\textcopyright} 1954 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Polarization switching in ferroelectric thin films occurs via nucleation and growth of 180domains through a highly inhomogeneous process in which the kinetics are largely controlled by defects, interfaces and pre-existing domain walls. Here we present the first real-time, atomic-scale observations and phase-field simulations of domain switching dominated by pre-existing, but immobile, ferroelastic domains in Pb(Zr 0.2 Ti 0.8)O 3 thin films. Our observations reveal a novel hindering effect, which occurs via the formation of a transient layer with a thickness of several unit cells at an otherwise charged interface between a ferroelastic domain and a switched domain. This transient layer possesses a low-magnitude polarization, with a dipole glass structure, resembling the dead layer. The present study provides an atomic level explanation of the hindering of ferroelectric domain motion by ferroelastic domains. Hindering can be overcome either by applying a higher bias or by removing the as-grown ferroelastic domains in fabricated nanostructures. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Despite its history, the microscopic mechanism for the Rashba spin-band splitting was not well understood. It was very recently pointed out that local orbital angular momentum (OAM) plays a crucial role in the Rashba effect. Subsequently, an effective Hamiltonian was proposed. The proposed Hamiltonian was found to not only explain all the known aspects of the Rashba phenomena but also correctly predict properties that were not known before. It brings about shifts from spin-based to OAM-based approaches in the understanding of the Rashba effect. Here, we review the developments in the new approach. Starting from a brief introduction, issues in the conventional understanding of the Rashba effect are discussed. It is then described in detail that local OAM results in significant electrostatic energy which along with the atomic spin-orbit coupling explains the Rashba effect. Experimental evidences for the existence of OAM from circular dichroism in angle resolved photoemission, thus the validity of the model, are also reviewed.},

In magnetic recording, magnetic fields have been used to read or write the information stored on the magnetization, which 'measures' the local orientation of spins in ferromagnets. The picture started to change in 1988, when the discovery of giant magnetoresistance opened the way to efficient control of charge transport through magnetization. The recent expansion of hard-disk recording owes much to this development. We are starting to see a new paradigm where magnetization dynamics and charge currents act on each other in nanostructured artificial materials. Ultimately, 'spin currents' could even replace charge currents for the transfer and treatment of information, allowing faster, low-energy operations: spin electronics is on its way. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

Calculated exchange energies for atoms fall within 1{\%} of Hartree-Fock values.

The Hamilton operator, the forces, and the stress tensor are derived for this modified PAW functional. A simple way to implement the PAW method in existing plane-wave codes supporting US pseudopotentials is pointed out. In addition, critical tests are presented to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the PAW and the US pseudopotential method with relaxed core all electron methods. These tests include small molecules (Formula presented) and several bulk systems (diamond, Si, V, Li, Ca, (Formula presented) Fe, Co, Ni).

@article{Inoue2015,
abstract = {The photovoltaic (PV) effect in polar materials offers great potential for light-energy conversion that generates a voltage beyond the bandgap limit of present semiconductor-based solar cells. Ferroelectrics have received renewed attention because of the ability to deliver a high voltage in the presence of ferroelastic domain walls (DWs). In recent years, there has been considerable debate over the impact of the DWs on the PV effects, owing to lack of information on the bulk PV tensor of host ferroelectrics. In this article, we provide the first direct evidence of an unusually large PV response induced by ferroelastic DWs-termed-PV effect. The precise estimation of the bulk PV tensor in single crystals of barium titanate enables us to quantify the giant PV effect driven by 90° DWs. We show that the DW-PV effect arises from an effective electric field consisting of a potential step and a local PV component in the 90° DW region. This work offers a starting point for further investigation into the DW-PV effect of alternative systems and opens a reliable route for enhancing the PV properties in ferroelectrics based on the engineering of domain structures in either bulk or thin-film form.},

Such trapped excess electrons may be responsible for the thermally activated electrical conductivity at domain walls observed in experiments. In the case of a periodic array of domain walls, the trapped excess electrons create a zigzag potential, whose amplitude depends on the electron concentration in the material and the domain-wall distance. The potential is asymmetric for 71° and 109° domain walls. This could modify the open-circuit voltage in a solar cell and hence influence the photoelectric effect in BiFeO3.},

abstract = {Multiferroic magnetoelectrics are materials that are both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric in the same phase. As a result, they have a spontaneous magnetization that can be switched by an applied magnetic field, a spontaneous polarization that can be switched by an applied electric field, and often some coupling between the two. Very few exist in nature or have been synthesized in the laboratory. In this paper, we explore the fundamental physics behind the scarcity of ferromagnetic ferroelectric coexistence. In addition, we examine the properties of some known magnetically ordered ferroelectric materials. We find that, in general, the transition metal d electrons, which are essential for magnetism, reduce the tendency for off-center ferroelectric distortion. Consequently, an additional electronic or structural driving force must be present for ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity to occur simultaneously. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Chemical Society.},
