\section{Introduction}
Efficient control and probing of robust order has historically been one of the main technological drivers for research in condensed matter.
The hallmark example is the impact that the discovery of giant magnetoresistance has had on the efficiency of the readhead in hard disks, by using direct electrical effects rather than a solenoid \cite{Baibich1988,Binasch1989,Tsymbal2001,Nunez2006TheoryMetals,Chappert2007}.
This is achieved by constructing the readhead as a multilayer sandwich composed of a pinned magnet, a non-magnetic metal and a soft magnet.
The latter will align itself to the information storing magnetic domains on the platter of the hard disk.
The resistivity of the stack then depends strongly on the mutual alignment of the pinned and soft magnets, as a result of the giant magnetoresistance.
By applying a constant bias voltage to the readhead, the magnetically stored information can be probed electrically through the measurement of the resulting current.
Underlying this mechanism is the Stoner effect, causing the conducting states around the Fermi level of metallic magnets to have a well-defined spin polarization depending on the internal magnetization.
If current flows through these metallic magnets, the carriers with aligned spins that exit the pinned magnet will be scattered strongly (leading to low conductivity) by the soft magnet if its magnetization is aligned antiparallel, and weakly when the magnetization of both is aligned (high conductivity).
This development led to a significant increase of the efficiency of hard drives.

There remains, however, the issue of writing the information in the first place.
In modern state-of-the art high density storage technologies, this is still done by applying an external magnetic field with an electromagnet to reorient the ferromagnetic domains. One can imagine this to be quite an inefficient process, both from the point of view of granularity (stray fields and non-locality of magnetic fields limit the minimum size of the domains) as from that of energy loss through heat dissipation.
Improving these figures of merit drives much of the current research in the field of spintronics, with promising applications like spin-transfer torque devices \cite{Nunez2006TheorySemiconductors,Nunez2006TheoryMetals,Nunez2011, Kent2015, Jungwirth2016}.
These use an inverse effect to the one described above.
In thase first a current is created with carriers that have a well-defined orientation of the spin by using e.g. a pinned ferromagnet as in the readhead.
Subsequently, this current is forced through (or close to) a magnetic domain by the bias electric field.
If the spin of the carriers and the magnetization of the domain are misaligned, strong scattering occurs which rotates the spin moments of the carriers.
However, this will cause an opposite torque on the magnetization of the domain, due to the conservation of angular momentum. This transfer of torque is where the classification of {\it spin-transfer torque} devices originates from.
If enough spin-polarized current flows through the domain, its magnetization will eventually be reoriented along the spins of the carriers. This method circumvents the need of electromagnets to create a magnetic field by using circular currents, greatly increasing the efficiency and allowing for greater domain density.
\\\\
It is clear that the longevity associated with magnetic order, combined with the ease and efficiency of manipulation through electrical means is highly desirable.
This brings us to the topic of this chapter, namely the magnetoelectric effect in multiferroic insulators.
As the name implies, the magnetoelectric effect allows for the electric control of magnetic order or the magnetic control of ferroelectric polarization~\cite{Spaldin2019,Khomskii2009,Fiebig2005,Fiebig2016,Cheong2007}, the former being the most attractive from a technological point of view.

In practice, however, the effectiveness of this cross-order control is often limited, and multiferroic materials are rare to begin with.
To understand why, we summarize briefly the review by Khomskii in Ref.~\cite{Khomskii2009}.
\\\\
Two main classes of multiferroic materials can be identified: type-I and type-II multiferroics.
In the former, the ferroelectric polarization and magnetic order stem from different origins, and are thus largely decoupled.
The latter, instead, develops ferroelectricity as a result of an inversion symmetry breaking magnetic configuration.
In this case the two orders are coupled strongly, but the size of the ferroelectric polarization is often limited, and generally much lower than for type-I multiferroics.
We use the ABO$_3$ perovskites with a magnetic transition metal B ion as an example, in order to understand why multiferroics are so rare.
\\\\
Magnetic order is almost exclusively caused by partially filled valence shells, in our example these are half-filled $d$ shells.
Ferroelectricity, on the other hand can find its origin in many microscopic effects.
In many of them, the ferroelectricity is caused by an off-center shift of the B ion in the surrounding oxygen octahedron (see Chapter~\ref{ch:Softening} for a detailed discussion on ferroelectricity in BaTiO$_3$).
This is due to the formation of strong covalent bonds between one (or three) oxygens and the B ion, using the latter's empty $d$ states. 
While it is not fully understood why, the presence of any electrons in the $d$ shell of the B ion severly hampers this process which is one of the root causes for the rarity of multiferroicity in these materials, since magnetism requires at least a partial filling of the $d$ shell.
One of the ways both orders can appear simultaneously is due to A ions that have lone pairs (filled outer $s$ shell). One example is in BiFeO$_3$, where the Bi$^{3+}$ ion harbors such a lone pair.
This pair of $s$ electrons is highly polarizable and all align in the ferroelectric phase.
BiFeO$_3$ is thus a clear example of a multiferroic material, however, the two orders have completely different origin and the cross-order coupling is thus extremely low.
The ordering temperatures for the ferroelectric and magnetic order in BiFeO$_3$ are 1100 K and 643 K, respectively, with a polarization $P \sim$ 90$\mu$C/cm$^2$.
For further details on the formation of the ferroelectricity in the other type-I cases, either through charge ordering or tilting of the oxygen octahedra, we refer the reader back to Ref.~\cite{Khomskii2009}.
\\\\
On the phenomenological side, one can write down a Landau free energy for a homogeneous type-I multiferroic by expanding the free energy $F$ in terms of ferroelectric polarization $P$ and magnetization $M$ (both scalars):
\begin{align}
	F(P, H) =& F_0 + \frac{a}{2} (T-T_P) P^2 + \frac{b}{4} P^4 - P E \\
	&+\frac{\alpha}{2} (T-T_M)M^2 + \frac{\beta}{4} M^4 - MH - \frac{g}{2}P^2 M^2.
\end{align}
This is the simplest form of the free energy of a multiferroic in terms of order parameters $P$ and $M$.
All coefficients are taken to be positive, such that below the ferroelectric (ferromagnetic) transition temperature $T_P$ ($T_M$) nonzero $P$ ($M$) develops.
The lowest order symmetry-allowed term that couples $P$ and $M$ is $-gP^2M^2$, obeying both the time reversal and inversion symmetries of the parent structure above the transition temperatures $T_P$ and $T_M$.
Minimizing the energy with respect to both orders for $T<T_M,T_P$ and no applied external fields, leads to
\begin{align}
	P^2 &= - a(T-T_P)/b + gM^2\\
	M^2 &= - \alpha(T-T_M)/\beta + gP^2.
\end{align}
Both order parameters thus depend on the value of the other through the magnetoelectric coupling $g$. This leads to a change in one when an external field is applied to the other.
As mentioned before, however, the different microscopic origins of both orders usually result in a tiny value for $g$.
Indeed, the effective dielectric constant $\varepsilon$ of BiMnO$_3$ only displays a weak anomaly at the ferromagnetic transition temperature, and is only weakly affected by an external magnetic field, leading to a variation of 0.6\% of $\varepsilon$ at a field value of 9\,T.
This means that the electrical behavior of this material is almost impervious to an extern magnetic field, a clear demonstration of the problems with cross-order control in type-I multiferroics.
\\\\
In an effort to improve this sought-after control, we turn to the type-II multiferroics.
As mentioned before, the ferroelectricity in these materials is a result of the inversion breaking magnetic order that sets in below $T_N$.
Due to the shared microscopic origin, the coupling between the magnetic and ferroelectric orders in these materials is generally much higher, leading to an increased magnetoelectric effect~\cite{Oh2014}.
However, one caveat is that in this case the ferroelectricity is much lower, since it improper rather than proper\footnote{The order parameter describing the ferroelectric polarization is a pure slave order parameter, that would not develop on its own in these materials. It is only nonzero because of the appearance of the primary order parameter that describes the magnetic order below $T_N$ (i.e. there is no $T_{FE}$).}.
This leads to a much reduced effectiveness of external electric fields as a method of effective control of the magnetic order.  
\\\\
Here, we specifically focus on GdMn$_2$O$_5$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell})~\cite{Khomskii2009}, demonstrating an exceptional tunability of the ferroelectric polarization through an applied magnetic field~\cite{Lee13}.
The orthorhombic $R$Mn$_2$O$_5$ manganites have a very complex crystalline structure (see Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell}), which leads to a wealth of different phases depending on the temperature, rare-earth ion $R$, external magnetic field and even electric-field poling history~\cite{Zheng2019}.
To keep the discussion tractable and in line with the experiments that were performed by our collaborators, we give a summary of the transitions and phases that are important for this chapter.
\\\\
$R$Mn$_2$O$_5$ have crystallographic group P$bam$ \cite{Alonso97} in the paramagnetic phase at high temperature, which is eventually lowered to P$_ab2_1a$ when the commensurate magnetic order condenses below $T_{N} \approx 33$ K.
This order is characterised by the propagation vector $\bm{k} = (1/2, 0, 0)$, i.e. there is a unit cell doubling along the crystalline $a$-direction.
The magnetic configuration repeats along the crystalline $c$-direction. The magnetic phase transition goes hand in hand with a sharp anomaly in the dielectric constant $\varepsilon_b$, signalling the onset of the improper ferroelectric polarization  along the $b$-direction ($P_b$) \cite{Lee13}.
When the temperature is lowered further, $P_b$ saturates to a maximum value of around 3600 $\mu$C/m$^2$, the largest found for any rare-earth magnanite.
However, it is still tiny compared to proper ferroelectrics like BaTiO$_3$ with $P \approx 3 \times 10^5 \mu $C/m$^2$ at room temperature \cite{Mason1948,VonHippel1950}.
The magnetic unit cell features two non-equivalent antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mn chains, which are formed by pyramidally coordinated Mn$^{3+}$ and octahedrally coordinated Mn$^{4+}$ ions, as indicated by the light blue lines and purple polygons in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell}.
The Mn spins inside the chains lie mostly along the fourfold symmetry axis of the Mn$^{3+}$ pyramids, making angles of $\pm 23.4^\circ$ with the $a$-axis.
\\\\

The yellow arrows denote the expanding bonds due to alignment of spins and AFM exchange, and the blue arrows denote contracting bonds.}
\end{figure}
The improper ferroelectricity is generated through the symmetric Heisenberg exchange striction, and the strong AFM exchanges combined with the geometric frustration of the Mn chains~\cite{Choi2008}.
This frustration appears due to the odd number of AFM bonds in the Mn pentagons that surround each Gd ion, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell}(a) and more clearly in panel (c).
Similar to the situation in AFM bonds on a triangular lattice, not all AFM exchanges can be simultaneously satisfied (i.e. by having completely antiparallel spins on each AFM bond).
When the magnetic order sets in, magnetic exchange energy is simultaneously optimized with the elastic energy on each bond.
This results in the contraction of bonds with a mostly antiparallel alignment of spins, and the extension of bonds with more parallel aligned spins.
A detailed demonstration is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell}(b-c) by the orange and blue arrows, respectively.
\\\\
The simplest form of this behavior can be understood by considering Heisenberg exchange between two spins $i$, $j$, on a dimer.
The exchange coefficient can be written in terms of the hopping $t_{ij}$ and Coulomb repulsion $U$ as: $J(r_i, r_j)\approx \frac{t_{ij}^2}{U}$.
It depends through $t_{ij}$ only the length of the bond, such that $J(r_i, r_j) = J(r_i - r_j) = J(r)$\footnote{In real materials this process is more complex due to the presence of multiple orbitals, and multiple neighboring ions.}.
The energy $W$ of each bond can then be written, following Ref. \cite{Harris1972}, as:
\begin{equation}
	W_{ij} = J(r)\bm{S}_i \cdot \bm{S}_j + \frac{\kappa \delta r^2}{2r_0},
\end{equation}
with spins $\bm{S}_i$ and $\bm{S}_j$, $\kappa$ the elastic stiffness of the bond, $r_0$ the mean separation between neighboring Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ ions in the paramagnetic state, and $\delta r = r - r_0$.
Minimizing the energy of the bond energy through $\frac{\partial W}{\partial r} = 0$ then leads to the change in bondlength $\delta r$ given by 
\begin{equation}
	\delta r = -\frac{\partial J}{\partial r}\frac{r_0}{\kappa}\bm{S}_i \cdot \bm{S}_j,
\end{equation}
when the magnetic order sets in below $T_N$. Thus, AFM bonds ($J > 0$) with antiparallel spins contract ($\delta r < 0$), and bonds with parallel spins extend ($\delta r > 0$).
In the case of $R$Mn$_2$O$_5$, this causes the ocatahedrally coordinated Mn$^{4+}$ ion to shift towards one of the two neighboring Mn$^{3+}$ pyramids in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- Mn$^{4+}$ -- Mn$^{3+}$ sequences, as showcased in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell}(b).
As mentioned before, this causes a lowering of the symmetry from P$bam$ to P$_ab2_1a$, and, as the Born effective charge of the Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ ions differs, to a nonzero polarization along the $b$-axis~\cite{Khomskii2009}.
It was shown, however, that this ionic displacement is largely compensated when electronic correlation effects are taken into account.
These lead to an additional increase of the electronic charge between the contracting ions, which almost fully cancels this contribution to the polarization.
\\\\
There is a second source of polarization in GdMn$_2$O$_5$, also due to the symmetric Heisenberg exchange striction but this time between the spins of Gd and Mn~\cite{Lee13}.
All the exchanges between Gd and the surrounding Mn ions are again AFM.
A similar train of thought can then be followed as before, causing the bonds with parallel spins to extend and those with antiparallel spins to contract (see Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell}(c)).
This contribution does not suffer from the same cancellation between ionic displacements and electronic charge, and leads to the majority of the ferroelectric polarization.

Gd$^{3+}$ is special with respect to the other magnetic rare-earth ions in the $R$Mn$_2$O$_5$ family, because it has a very isotropic electronic configuration (4$f^7$), i.e. there is no unquenched orbital angular momentum and associated anisotropic charge distribution (as discussed profusely in the Rashba Chapter~\ref{ch:Rashba}). This means that the large spin (nominally $S=7/2$) can orient itself freely to optimize the magnetic interactions with its neighboring Mn atoms, without incurring any penalties through the atomic SOC combined with nonzero OAM.
This leads to a high magnetic susceptibility and associated magnetoelectric effect, surpassing the other $R$Mn$_2$O$_5$ compounds both in size and tunability of $P_b$, with a measured variation of up to 5000\,$\mu$ C/m$^2$ when a magnetic field is applied~\cite{Lee13}. 
\\\\
Now that the stage is set, we continue with a description of the puzzling experimental observations that motivated the study in this chapter.
Afterwards, we continue with a description in terms of an effective spin Hamiltonian in terms of the Gd spins, and the AFM orderparameters $\bm L$ describing the two Mn chains.
We demonstrate that this description works remarkably well in order to reproduce the overall behavior that is observed in the experiments.
After discussing the complex behavior that arises from the model, we comment on the generality of the observations, followed by a final summary of the effect. 
%Even though the AFM intrachain superexchange interactions dominate over the AFM interchain interactions, there is nonetheless a geometric frustration due to the crystal structure, which can be seen most easily seen from the Mn pentagons surrouding the Gd atoms. This means that all AFM exchanges can not be satisfied at the same time, causing certain Mn bonds between the chains to have energetically unfavorable spin alignment. This leads to the first contribution to the ferroelectric polarization through Heisenberg exchange striction, lengthening bonds that have parallel spins and shortening those that have antiparallel ones.

\caption{ \label{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment2} {\bf Angle and temperature dependence of the four-state switching.} By comparing panels (a) and (b) we can see that the sign of the field angle $\phi_H$ does not matter for the four-state switching. c) Temperature dependence of the switching hysteresis at the magic angle. Above 4 K (upper panel) the more usual two-state hysteresis is observed, whereas below 4 K (lower panel) the four-state behavior starts to arise. The states, colors and arrows are indicated in the same way as in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}.}
\end{figure}

The measurements we present in this section were performed in the group of A. Pimenov, on single crystal GdMn$_2$O$_5$ samples grown by S. Cheong's group.
Magnetic fields were applied to the sample under varying angles $\phi_H$ with respect to the crystalline $a$-axis, and swept up and down while tracking the evolution of $P_b$.
Only positive fields were applied, but as it turns out, the behavior is identical for fields that are offset by 180$^\circ$. 
In previous experimental measurements, the magnetic field was only applied along the crystalline $a$-axis, i.e. $\phi_H = 0$~\cite{Lee13}.
The results for the low temperature measurements are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}.
\\\\
In the following we will refer to three distinct switching regimes: the low angle, ``magic'' angle, and high angle regime.
They correspond to the values of $\phi_H$ shown in panels (a), (b), and (c) respectively.
Before delving into a detailed analysis of the experiments, we would like to point out that the low angle behavior shown in left side of panel (a) does not coincide with the behavior found in previous experiments in Ref.~\cite{Lee13} on the same sample, which is shown on the right.
There it was found that when the field is applied along the $a$-axis, a two-state switching with a reversal of the polarization is observed, similar to the 1--4 branch in panel (b) of Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}.
We are not quite sure what leads to this discrepancy between the measurements. It could be related to the poling history of the sample or some domain related behavior.
For now, this discrepancy is not that important, but it is nonetheless at odds with our theoretical findings which demonstrate a behavior similar to the previous measurements in Ref.~\cite{Lee13}. 
\\\\
Turning back to the results shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}, we see that the switching behavior changes significantly with $\phi_H$.
In the high angle case, displayed in panel (c), we can observe a two state switching behavior, in which $P_b$ does not vary much, but a clear jump appears around a field magnitude of 5 T.
This signals a sudden change in the magnetic configuration of the system, since $P_b$ is a direct result of it.
The most peculiar, and completely novel, behavior can be found around the magic angle $\phi_H \sim 9^\circ$ in panel (b) of Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}.
During the up-down-up-down field sweeps in this switching regime, we find that four different states are visited sequentially, with four different values for $P_b$.
\\\\
At this stage, we would like to draw the attention of the reader to two facts.

First, compared to the usual magnetoelectric switching with one low-field state and one high-field state, here a single up--down cycle of the field reverses the polarization, and correspondingly leads to a different final state.
In order to return the system to its original configuration another up--down cycle is required.

Second, this four-state loop is fully deterministic, meaning that when multiple such double cycles are applied, the system tracks close to exactly the same $P_b$ loop every time.
\\\\
If we ignore for a brief moment the low-angle behavior displayed in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}(a), and replace it with the behavior on the right~\cite{Lee13}, i.e. following the 1--4 branch in panel (b), we can imagine the four-state switching as an interpolation between the high and low angle switching regimes.
This is a very important observation and will lead to one of the main results of this work: the topological nature of the magnetoelectric switching in this material.
\\\\
Turning now to the measurements displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment2}, we find that the four-state loop does not depend on the sign of $\phi_H$ (compare panels (a,b)).
From the two panels in (c), displaying measurements with $\phi_H$ along the magic angle, but at two different temperatures (15 K and 4 K), we can observe that the four-state hysteresis loop only appear at low temperatures.
For higher temperatures a more usual two-state loop is found, similar to the high angle loop in panel (c) of Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}.
\\\\
To conclude this section we would like to comment that we focus on the overall switching behavior, i.e. we ignore the many interesting details that can be found by careful study of the $P_b$ graphs.
For example, in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}(b) one can find three distinct steps that appear around 5 T during the 1$\rightarrow$2 and 3$\rightarrow$4 switching.
These steps are, however, absent at the same field magnitude, when the system is on the 2$\rightarrow$3 and 4$\rightarrow$1 branch.
Their origin might be related to a transition, on an ionic level, to states with higher Gd spin, or it might be related to the spins in the Mn chains rotating individually, rather than in unison as we will assume in our model.
These features could be the subject of further research, here we choose to focus on unravelling the main behavior of the four-state loop flanked in $\phi_H$ parameter-space by two more usual two-state switching loops.
% This novel four-state switching is the focus of this chapter, and is found to originate from a unidirectional rotational motion of the spins, a sort of microscopic magnetic analogue to the crankshaft in a car, converting the linear back--and--forth variation of the magnetic field into spin rotations.

\section{Modeling}
In order to describe the puzzling experimantal observations we construct a semi classical model with eight Gd spins and two AFM order parameters that describe the Mn chains.
The Gd spins are described by unit vectors $\bm{S}_i, i=1..8$, and we denote the two AFM order parameters as $\bm{L}_\alpha, \alpha=1,2$ (also unit vectors). See Fig~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell} for further details.
Furthermore, the electric polarization is represented by the slave order parameter $P_b$.
Using a single $\bm{L}_\alpha$ to describe the orientation of all the Mn ions in a chain assumes that their spins are perfectly AFM ordered, i.e. $\bm{S}_i = L, \bm{S}_{i+1} = - \bm{L}$.
This simplification is justified by the large intrachain AFM exchanges, compared with the relatively small exchanges between the two chains.

A further simplification we adopt here is to confine all spins to the $ab$-plane.
It was shown experimentally that indeed the $c$-direction acts as the magnetic hard-axis, and that the magnetic order is repeated along the crystalline $c$-direction~\cite{Lee13}.
This lowers the dimensionality of the problem from 3D to 2D, with a single angle for every Gd spin and Mn chain as the remaining degrees of freedom, thus greatly simplifying the numerical complexity.
Since all spins and AFM order parameters are taken as unit vectors, their sizes are implicitely included in the model parameters.
\\\\
The first step in order to derive the effective Hamiltonian in terms of the above order parameters is to convert the microscopic interactions of the individual Mn spins into the effective interactions of the $\bm{L}_\alpha$.
More specifically, we include energy contributions due to small spin cantings away from the perfect collinear intrachain spin configuration, as showcased in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_canting}.

\begin{figure*}[h]
    \centering
    \IncludeGraphics[width=\linewidth]{canting}
	\caption{{\bf Energy contributions due to spin canting.} a) The Zeeman contribution due to the weak ferromagnetic moment along the field (H, red arrow), as a result of the spin canting. b) The contribution due to Heisenberg exchange when previously parallel Mn spins are canted towards a more AFM alignment. This is a direct result of the geometric frustration. The collinear configuration is denoted by the black arrows, with the dashed teal arrows showing the orientation due to the slight canting by the angle $\delta \theta$. \label{fig:GdMn2O5_canting}}
\end{figure*}

Starting with the contribution due to the Zeeman energy when a magnetic field is applied, we can write 
\begin{equation}
	E_Z = -g \mu_B \bm{H} \cdot (\pmb{\sigma}_i + \pmb{\sigma}_{i+1})\nonumber,
\end{equation}
where $g \approx 2$, $\mu_B$ denotes the Bohr magneton, and $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_{i+1}$ two neighboring Mn spins inside a chain. 
Obviously, no energy gain is possible for perfectly antiparallel spins since then $(\pmb{\sigma}_i + \pmb{\sigma}_{i+1})=0$.

However, if both spins cant slightly towards the applied field, a weak ferromagnetic moment is created that will couple to the magnetic field (see Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_canting}(a)).
To include this contribution, we perform an expansion in the small canting angle $\delta \theta$ away from the collinear configuration:
\begin{align}
	E &= \Jpar \cos(2\delta \theta) - g \mu_B H \left[\cos(\theta_L - \theta_H + \delta \theta) + \cos(\theta_L + 180^\circ - \theta_H - \delta \theta)\right],\nonumber\\
	&= \Jpar \left( 1+2\delta\theta^2 \right) - 2 g \mu_B H \sin(\theta_L - \theta_H)\delta\theta \label{eq:GdMn2O5_zeeman_exp},
\end{align}
where $\Jpar$ denotes the intrachain magnetic exchange coefficient, and $\theta_L$ ($\theta_H$) the angle between $L$ ($H$) and the $a$-axis.
Minimizing with respect to $\delta \theta$ then leads to
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial E}{\partial \delta \theta} = 0 &= 4 \Jpar \delta \theta - 2 g \mu_B H \sin(\theta_L - \theta_H) \nonumber\\
	&\Leftrightarrow \nonumber\\
	\delta \theta &= \frac{g\mu_B H \sin(\theta_L - \theta_H)}{2 \Jpar}.\nonumber
\end{align}
Inserting this expression for $\delta \theta$ back into Eq.~\eqref{eq:GdMn2O5_zeeman_exp}, and keeping only the first order terms, we obtain the following expression for the Zeeman contribution through spin canting:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:GdMn2O5_Zeeman}
	E_Z &= -\frac{g^2\mu_B^2 H^2 \sin(\theta_L - \theta_H)^2}{\Jpar} = -\frac{g^2\mu_B^2 H^2 \left(1 - \cos(\theta_L - \theta_H)^2\right)}{\Jpar}\\
	&=\frac{g^2\mu_B^2}{\Jpar}\left((\bm{H}\cdot\bm{L})^2 - H^2\right)\nonumber
\end{align}
This energy gain is maximized when $\bm{L}$ is oriented perpendicular to $\bm{H}$ leading to $\bm L \cdot \bm H = 0$, which is exactly what happens in the well-known spin-flop transition.
There, through the application of a strong enough magnetic field along the easy-axis of an AFM system, sudden flip of the spins away from the easy-axis occurs as soon as the gain from the Zeeman energy overcomes the lost easy-axis anisotropy energy. This spin-flopped state, with the AFM order perpendicular to $\bm{H}$, is exactly the one displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_canting}(a).
\\\\
An additional energy contribution is a result of the geometric frustration which forces certain spins in the two chains to be parallel to each other, as shown by the two rightmost arrows in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_canting}(b).
This is very unfavorable for the interchain AFM exchange with coefficient $\Jperp$, again leading to some gained energy if these spins cant slightly towards a more AFM alignment.
\\\\
Adopting a similar strategy as above, this contribution can be derived starting from
\begin{equation}
	E_{ic} = 2 \Jpar \cos(\delta \theta) + \Jperp \left(\cos(\theta_1 + \delta \theta - \theta_2) - \cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2 -\delta \theta)\right),
\end{equation}
where $\theta_1$ ($\theta_2$) signifies the angle w.r.t. the $a$-axis of $\bm{L}_1$ ($\bm{L}_2$).
Expanding again to second order leads to
\begin{equation}
	E_{ic} = 2 \Jpar ( 1+ \delta \theta^2) - 2 \Jperp \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2)\delta \theta. \label{eq:GdMn2O5_Eic_exp}
\end{equation}
Again minimizing this contribution in terms of $\delta \theta$, we find
\begin{equation}
	\delta \theta = \frac{\Jperp}{2 \Jpar} \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2).
\end{equation}
Substituting $\delta \theta$ into Eq.~\eqref{eq:GdMn2O5_Eic_exp}, while keeping only terms up to first order in $\frac{\Jperp^2}{\Jpar}$ since it is assumed that $\Jperp << \Jpar$, leads to the final expression for this energy contribution:
\begin{equation}
	E_{ic} = -\frac{\Jperp^2}{\Jpar}\sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2)^2 =  \frac{\Jperp^2}{\Jpar}(\cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2) - 1) = \frac{\Jperp^2}{\Jpar}(\bm{L}_1 \cdot \bm{L}_2)^2 - \frac{\Jperp^2}{\Jpar},
\end{equation}
where the last contribution is a constant, merely causing a shift in the energy, and can thus be omitted in our numerical simulations.
The maximum gain in energy ($\frac{\Jperp^2}{\Jpar}$) is achieved when the chains are oriented perpendicular to each other ($\bm L_1 \cdot \bm L_2 = 0$).
\\\\
These two contributions (Zeeman and Heisenberg exchange) compete with each other, and with the easy-axis anisotropy energy
\begin{equation}
	E_{ea} = -K_L\sum_\alpha(\bm{L}_\alpha\cdot \bm{n}_\alpha)^2,
\end{equation}
where $K_L$ denotes the strength of the easy-axis anisotropy, and $\bm n_\alpha$ denote the orientation of the easy axes:
$\bm{n}_1=\left(\cos(\theta_n), \sin(\theta_n)\right)$ and $\bm{n}_2=\left(\cos(-\theta_n), \sin(-\theta_n)\right)$ with $\theta_n = \rm{23.4}^\circ$.
These are the fourfold axes of the pyramidally coordinated Mn ions, aligned with the long edges of the cyan chains in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell}(a).
\\\\
Bringing everything together leads us to the contribution to the effective Hamiltonian that originates from the chains:
\begin{equation}
	H_L = \gamma(\bm{L}_1\cdot \bm{L}_2)^2
    +\sum_{\alpha}\chi((\bm{H}\cdot \bm{L}_\alpha)^2-H^2)
    -K_L\sum_\alpha(\bm{L}_\alpha\cdot \bm{n}_\alpha)^2\label{eq:GdMn2O5_hami_1},
\end{equation}
with $\gamma = \frac{\Jperp^2}{\Jpar}$, and $\chi = \frac{g^2\mu_B^2}{\Jpar}$. 
\\\\
The next step is to find the combination of cross-order coupling terms between $\bm S_i$ and $\bm L_\alpha$ that transform as the unit representation of the symmetry group of the system.
This combination of energy terms will then be invariant under all the symmetry operations of the system as is required.
In order to achieve this, we first list the generators of the paramagnetic parent P$bam$ phase:
\begin{align}
	I &: (x, y, z) \rightarrow (-x, -y, -z)\\
	2_z &: (x, y, z) \rightarrow (-x, -y, z)\\
	2_y &: (x, y, z) \rightarrow (\frac{1}{2} - x, \frac{1}{2} + y, z)
\end{align}
$I$ and $2_z$ are the same symmetry operations in the 2D case we are solving.
Next, a doubling of the unit cell is necessary to fit the overall AFM state, leading to an additional symmetry operation for the translation along the $a$-axis $a: (x, y, z) \rightarrow (x + a, y, z)$ (not taking spins into account), and a halving of the fractional translation $2_y: (x, y, z) \rightarrow (\frac{1}{4} - x, \frac{1}{2}+y, z)$.
In effect, applying these symmetry operations to the degrees of freedom, bearing in mind the spin flip when transforming the chains between the two halves of the magnetic unit cell, leads to the following transformation table:
\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:GdMn2O5_symm}{\bf Symmetry operations in GdMn$_2$O$_5$.}}
\end{table}\\\\
We start with the Heisenberg exchange terms between the Gd spins ($\bm{S}_i$) and the Mn chains ($\bm{L}_1$ and $\bm{L}_2$), with the effective exchange constants $v_1$ and $v_2$.
The former (latter) couples each Gd spin with the chain that harbors the closest (furthest) Mn ion. See the yellow arrows in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell}(a) for a schematic depiction of these exchange paths.
Starting from terms with $\bm{S}_1$ and $\bm{S}_2$, and taking the above table of transformations into account, we can identify the following sets of terms:
\begin{align}
	\bm{S}_1\cdot(v_1 \bm{L}_2 + v_2 \bm{L}_1) \xrightarrow{I} \bm{S_8}\cdot(v_1 \bm{L}_2 - v_2 \bm{L}_1) \xrightarrow{a} \bm{S_4} \cdot (- v_1 \bm{L}_2 + v_2 \bm{L}_1) \xrightarrow{I} \bm{S_5} \cdot (-v_1 \bm{L}_2 - v_2 \bm{L}_1), \nonumber\\
	\bm{S}_2\cdot(v_1 \bm{L}_1 + v_2 \bm{L}_2) \xrightarrow{I} \bm{S_7}\cdot(-v_1 \bm{L}_1 + v_2 \bm{L}_2) \xrightarrow{a} \bm{S_3} \cdot (v_1 \bm{L}_1 - v_2 \bm{L}_2) \xrightarrow{I} \bm{S_6} \cdot (-v_1 \bm{L}_1 - v_2 \bm{L}_2).
\end{align}
The combined sum of them transforms according to the identity representation, leading to the following contribution to the total Hamiltonian:
\begin{align}
    H_{LS} =& (\bm{S}_1 - \bm{S}_5) \cdot (v_1 \bm{L}_2 + v_2 \bm{L}_1) + (\bm{S}_2 - \bm{S}_6) \cdot (v_1 \bm{L}_1 + v_2 \bm{L}_2) + \nonumber \\ &(\bm{S}_3 - \bm{S}_7) \cdot (v_1 \bm{L}_1 - v_2 \bm{L}_2) + (\bm{S}_4 - \bm{S}_8) \cdot (-v_1 \bm{L}_2 + v_2 \bm{L}_1).
\end{align}
A similar process can be applied starting from $P_b \, \bm{S_1}\cdot(\beta_2 \bm{L}_1 + \beta_3 \bm{L}_2)$ and $P_b\, \bm{S_2}\cdot(\beta_2 \bm{L}_1 + \beta_3 \bm{L}_2)$, which signify the symmetric Heisenberg exchange striction contribution to the Hamiltonian. This leads to
\begin{align}
	H_{P_b}=&-P_b[E_b + \beta_1 (\bm{L}_1\cdot \bm{L}_2)+
    (\bm{S}_1-\bm{S}_5)(\beta_2 \bm{L}_2 + \beta_3 \bm{L}_1) +
    (\bm{S}_2-\bm{S}_6)(\beta_2 \bm{L}_1 + \beta_3 \bm{L}_2) \nonumber\\ 
    &+(\bm{S}_3-\bm{S}_7)(\beta_2 \bm{L}_2 - \beta_3 \bm{L}_1) +
    (\bm{S}_4-\bm{S}_8)(\beta_2 \bm{L}_1 - \beta_3 \bm{L}_2)],
\end{align}
where the facultative interaction of $P_b$ with an external electric field $E_b$ was also included. 
We can identify three final terms that originate purely from the Gd spins:
\begin{equation}
     H_S=\frac{1}{2}(g \mu_B)^2\sum_{i\neq j}\left(\frac{\bm{S}_i\cdot \bm{S}_j}{r_{ij}^3}-3\frac{(\bm{S}_i\cdot \bm{r}_{ij})(\bm{S}_j\cdot \bm{r}_{ij})}{r_{ij}^5}\right) - \sum_i\left( K_S(\bm{N}_i\cdot \bm{S}_i)^2 + g\mu_\mathrm{B} \bm{H} \cdot \bm{S}_i\right). 
\end{equation}
The first describes the magnetodipolar interaction between Gd spins, which could be relatively large due to the size of the spins and relative proximity to the neighbors.
In the numerical simulations these interactions were restricted to their five nearest neighbors, including periodic images.
Adding further neighbors did not lead to qualitative differences in the results.
The term with $K_S$ denotes the easy-axis anisotropy for the Gd ions, this time with anisotropy axes $\bm{N}_i$ which are unit vectors having alternating angles $\pm 12^\circ$ with respect to the $a$-axis.
$K_S$ is significantly smaller than $K_L$ due to the isotropic environment and valence configuration of the Gd ions.
The final term denotes the Zeeman energy of the Gd ions in the external magnetic field $\bm{H}$.
\\\\
To conclude this section, we gather all the terms in our effective Hamiltonian:
\begin{multline}
    \label{eq:GdMn2O5_model}
    H=\gamma(\bm{L}_1\cdot \bm{L}_2)^2 +\sum_{\alpha}\chi((\bm{H}\cdot \bm{L}_\alpha)^2-H^2)\\

     \\+ \sum_{i,\alpha}V_{i\alpha}\bm{S}_i\cdot \bm{L}_\alpha \\

    +(\bm{S}_4-\bm{S}_8)(\beta_2 \bm{L}_1 - \beta_3 \bm{L}_2)]
    + P_b^2/2.
\end{multline}

\section{Methods \label{sec:GdMn2O5_methods}}
Before continuing with the results and a discussion of the physics, we comment briefly on the numerical side of this Chapter.\\\\
The first question to address is what model parameters to use in conjunction with the Hamiltonian in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GdMn2O5_model}.
This is not particularly straightforward, since our model is phenomenological, and the order parameters and interactions arise from a combination of the microscopic ones.
One could formulate, instead, a model in terms of all the microscopic degrees of freedom, i.e. all the spins of both Gd and Mn ions.
Not only would that lead to a more computationally demanding model, the increased complexity makes developing an intuitive understanding that much harder\footnote{As we will see, even this model leads to very intricate behavior that is hard to disentangle and rationalize fully}.
That means that calculating the coefficients from first-principles calculations is very hard, if not impossible. Even in the case of a fully microscopic spin model, it is not well-known in general how to acquire a correct set of exchange parameters from DFT.
In any case, we chose here to rather make physically inspired initial guesses for the model parameters, after which we further refined these in order to best reproduce the experimental behavior.
\\\\
We know, for example, that the Gd -- Mn magnetic exchange parameter towards the closest chain is larger than towards the other ($v_1>v_2$), and that the order of magnitude for this energy contribution is a couple of meV.
Furthermore, we mentioned a couple of times already that the single-ion anisotropy energy for Gd is expected to be small due to the isotropic envirnment and valence configuration with completely quenched orbital angular momentum.
Instead, the single-ion anisotropy of the Mn ions and, by proxy, the chains is again on the order of a couple of meV.
Lastly, due to the large intrachain $\Jpar$ and small interchain $\Jperp$ magnetic exchanges, we know that $\gamma = \frac{\Jperp^2}{\Jpar}$ and $\chi = \frac{\Jpar}{g^2\mu_B^2}$ are very small.
\\\\
Taking all these considerations into account, we found that the following model parameters reproduce the observations of the experiments well:  
$v_1 = 7.9$~meV, $v_2 = 0.15$~meV, $K_L = 1.1$~meV, $K_S = 0.09$~meV, $\gamma = 0.05$~meV, $\chi=0.01$~meV$^{-1}$.
The parameters for the exchange striction were then chosen to fit the experimental hysteresis loop as well as possible:
${\beta_1 = 0.06\,\mu}$C/cm$^2$, $\beta_2 = 0.06\:\mu$C/cm$^2$, $\beta_3 = 0.04\:\mu$C/cm$^2$.
\\\\
However, these parameters are by no means a requirement for the overarching behavior to exist. As we will show in greater detail in the following section, more specifically in the context of the discussion on the topological nature of the switching, a great deal of freedom exists in choosing these parameters, if the only requirement is to reproduce the three switching regimes.
This lies at the heart of our claim that this effect might exist in other materials, since neither the model nor the parameters depend greatly on the microscopic details of GdMn$_2$O$_5$. 
\\\\
The next question is how to simulate the experimental set-up, which is, in contrast to the question about the model parameters, much easier to answer.
Since the behavior only shows up at temperatures below $\sim$ 4 K, is remarkably deterministic, and through the application of slow varying fields, we simulated the process as a series of simple minimization problems.
This entails taking one of the degenerate starting configurations, increasing the field, minimizing the energy, applying a further increased field, and so on, thus tracking the local minimum at all steps.
It is quite remarkable that performing this relatively simple process, purely based on optimizing the energetics of the system, leads to a faithful reproduction of the observed behavior.
This is another indication of the topological nature of the switching behavior.
As we will show more explicitely below, it is sort of an extreme variant of the behavior of Thouless charge pumps, and especially of the recent realization in ultracold gases. \cite{Rice82,Thouless1982,Thouless83,Lohse16,Nakajima16, Atala13}.
It is extreme in the sense that it requires no tunneling whatsoever, which forms the core of the fully deterministic behavior.
\\\\

We now turn to a discussion of the results obtained from the simulations of the effective spin Hamiltonian Eq.~\eqref{eq:GdMn2O5_model}.

\end{figure}

The results of the earlier described simulation procedure are showcased in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}.

Let us first focus on panels (a-c), corresponding to the same three regimes displayed in panels (a-c) of the experimental figure ~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}, which demonstrate that our simulations reproduce the experimental observations well (taking the right hand side of Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}(a) for the low angle regime).
% We can identify the reversal of the polarization in the low angle regime, toggling between states 1 and 4, the small variation of $P_b$ for the high angle regime, toggling between states 1 and 2, and finally the magic angle regime where the four states are cycled through sequentially.
The insets in each panel depict schematically the states that are visited by the system during the field sweeps.

As mentioned before, it appears that the magic angle regime (Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(b)) is an interpolation between the low and high angle switching behaviors.
At the start, it follows the high angle behavior moving 1$\rightarrow$2, then, mimicking the low angle behavior results in a reversal of the polarization on the 2$\rightarrow$3 branch, followed by an inversion symmetry partner of the high angle regime moving 3$\rightarrow$4 and finally another low angle-like reversal of the polarization, bringing the system from 4 back to the starting state 1. 
\\\\
The trajectories through ($\phi_{L_1}$, $\phi_{L_2}$)-space, shown by the white lines in the bottom panels (d-f) of the same figure, hint at the same conclusion.
By connecting the trajectory of the low angle regime in (d) with the one at high angle in (f), and adding an inversion partner of both (i.e. one shifted by $\pi$ degrees along $\phi_{L_1}$), we arrive at the trajectory of the magic angle regime in (e).
The background energy surfaces are chosen to reflect how the barriers at an intermediate field value inside the hysteresis region differ depending on $\phi_H$.
We will come back to these statements in the next section, as they are quite crucial.
\\\\
In order to gain a deeper understanding of this peculiar behavior, we focus first on the energetics of the model as calculated by the simulations.
The intricaties of the energetics are ultimately what results in the deterministic, unidirectional, switching of the system.

\subsection{Energetics}
Before continuing, let us take a moment to recall some of the symmetries of the system, whose transformation properties were listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:GdMn2O5_symm} during the construction of the Hamiltonian.
We focus on how the transformations due to inversion ($I$) and time-reversal ($TR$) symmetry relate the angles of $\bm L_1$ and $\bm L_2$.
The energy surfaces depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap} in terms of these angles, for various field values $|H|$ when $\phi_H = +10^\circ$, may aid the reader in visualizing these symmetry operations.
We observe there that there are four degenerate energy minima, a result from the breaking of both symmetries in the low temperature phase.
The angles $\phi_{L_1}$ and $\phi_{L_2}$ that describe in part the state of the system, can be transformed into one another through the relations:
\begin{align}
	I:\qquad &(\phi_{L_1}, \phi_{L_2}) \rightarrow (\phi_{L_1}+\pi, \phi_{L_2}),\\
	TR:\qquad &(\phi_{L_1}, \phi_{L_2})\rightarrow(\phi_{L_1}+\pi, \phi_{L_2}+\pi).
\end{align}
These symmetry operations are indicated by the black arrows of the top left panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap}.
\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\IncludeGraphics[width=\textwidth]{field_heatmap1}
	\caption{{\bf Energy Surfaces in terms of $(\phi_{L_1}, \phi_{L_2})$ for $\phi_H =+10^\circ$.} The shaded dots denote the four degenerate minima. The full white dot corresponds to the example situation discussed in the main text. An indication of its trajectory during a double up--down field sweep is given by the shaded lines. The two black arrows denote the time-reversal (TR) and inversion (I) operations.\label{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap}}
\end{figure*}
\\\\
When the strength of the magnetic field increases, we see that two long vertical ``valleys'' appear along the $\phi_{L_1}$ direction of the energy surface, separated by $\pi$ along $\phi_{L_2}$.
We focus on the case where the initial state of the system corresponds to the top left mininum, indicated by the bright white dot in the top left panel, and a single up--down field sweep is applied.
Following its trajectory, indicated by the shaded white lines, we find that the system flows from the original minimum to the one that is related by inversion symmetry.
This has rotated $\phi_{L_1}$ by $\pi$, while it left $\phi_{L_2}$ unchanged.
Through the $\bm L_1 \cdot \bm L_2$ part of the exchange striction, this causes the reversal of $P_b$ which is consistent with the inversion symmetry operation.
The process we have described here corresponds to the first up--down cycle of the $P_b$ plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(b), i.e. the one that leads to the 1$\rightarrow$2$\rightarrow$3 branch.

As it turns out, when the field is swept up and down a second time, the state progresses through the valley in the same direction, i.e. downwards through the edge on the bottom of the window, reappearing on the top, and finally landing in the original top left minimum.
This corresponds to the 3$\rightarrow$4$\rightarrow$1 branch of Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(b).
The exact trajectory that the system thus follows in ($\phi_{L_1}$,$\phi_{L_2}$) space is summarized in panel (e) of the same figure.
\\\\
The sequence of states visited during this double up--down cycle of the field at $\phi_H = 10^\circ$, constitutes half of the possible configurations of the system (two low field and two high field states).
The other half is related to the first by time-reversal symmetry as indicated by the diagonal black arrow in the top left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap}.
A similar trajectory through this valley on the right hand side of the energy surface would be followed if the initial state were one of the two zero field minima it harbors. 
We can thus conclude that the up--down cycling of the magnetic field at $\phi_H=10^\circ$ does not allow for a transition between the two valleys, and $\phi_{L_2}$ changes very little during the cycling process.
\\\\
From the trajectories shown in Fig.\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(d, f) for the two state regimes, i.e. the low and high angle regimes, respectively, we can deduce that no such unidirectional motion through the whole energy surface occurs when $\phi_H$ is away from the magic angle.
This is rather puzzling since one would imagine that the minima behave in a similar way as in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap} they are required to obey the same symmetries.

In fact, they do.
\\\\
However, and this is really the crux of the matter, the barriers between the minima do not. As it turns out, there are no symmetries that relate the barriers that flank a minimum from either side.
This allows for them to change asymmetrically.
From our observations, it is the field angle $\phi_H$ that influences these asymmetric barriers, ultimately resulting in the three different switching regimes.
\\\\
We thus turn to a more careful investigation of the barriers, first by studying the results of Nudged Elastic Band simulations, displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_neb}, followed by a simple theoretical argument.
\\\\
\begin{figure}[h]
    \IncludeGraphics{neb}

The plots are shifted vertically, and magnetodipolar interactions were enhanced by a factor of 5.3 for clarity. This latter increases the width of the hysteresis region. The curve colors encode the corresponding magnetic field strength. The blue circles and arrows show the trajectory of the energy minimum due to field sweeps.

    }
\end{figure}
%
The Nudged Elastic Band calculations are a way to track how the low points of the valley in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap} change for different field strengths.
Similar to the previous discussion, we track the evolution of the sytem starting in state 1, indicated at the far left of Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_neb}(a).
In the following we use {\it ij} to denote the energy barrier between states i and j.
\\\\
As the field increases (color change and vertical shift) the local minimum around state 1 becomes metastable when the barrier 12 between state 1 and 2 vanishes.
Notice that at the point where the system moves to state 2, i.e. when the barrier 12 vanishes, the one between 14 is still present.
When the field is lowered, the barrier 23 lowers faster than 12, causing the system to progress to state 3.
A similar process then brings state 3$\rightarrow$4$\rightarrow$1 during the next up--down field sweep, since the barriers 34 and 12  (14 and 23) are related by the inversion transformation and  $E_{34} = E_{12}$ ($E_{41} = E_{23}$) (see the effect of {\it I} in Fig.\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap} for a visual confirmation of this statement).
From this analysis it is clear that indeed the barriers evolve asymmetrically when the field changes.
This is not surprising seen as the states at the top of the barriers\footnote{They are a combination of the states on either side of the barrier.} that flank a given minimum are in no way related by symmetry.

As a side note: this evolution of the potential energy surface is equivalent to that of a Thouless charge pump, in particular, the one induced by circular motion in the two-dimensional parameter space of the Rice-Mele model~\cite{Rice82} recently realized in ultracold gases \cite{Lohse16,Nakajima16,Atala13}.
\\\\
Combining the demonstration of the asymmetric evolution of the barriers in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_neb}, with the earlier discussion on the energy surfaces shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap} and the angle dependent trajectories shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(d-f) leads us to the following conclusion.
When the field is applied at a low angle, the barrier between states 1 and 4 is always lower than between states 1 and 2, causing a 1$\rightarrow$4$\rightarrow$1 sequence as in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(a).
Conversely, when the field is applied at a high angle, the barrier towards state 2 is always lower than towards state 4, leading to the 1$\rightarrow$2$\rightarrow$1 toggling shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(c).
There then has to exist a crossover angle where a combination of the two appears, leading in this case to the unidirectional cycling between 1$\rightarrow$2$\rightarrow$3$\rightarrow$4 as depicted in Figs.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(b), ~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap}, and \ref{fig:GdMn2O5_neb}(a).
\\\\
%
To hint at the origin of the asymmetric barrier evolution from a theoretical point of view, we can perform a simple Taylor expansion for the barrier energies 12, 23 at a field strength $H^*$ when $E_{12} = E_{23}$, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_neb}(b).
This can be written as,
\begin{equation}
	E(H) = E(H^*) + \left.\frac{\partial E}{\partial H}\right|_{H=H^*}(H - H^*).
\end{equation}
Filling in $\frac{\partial E}{\partial H} = -M$, and subtracting the expressions for both barriers, we find:
\begin{equation}
	E_{12}(H) - E_{23}(H) = (M_{23} - M_{12})(H - H^*),
\end{equation}
where $M_{ij}$ denotes the value of the total magnetization for the state at barrier {\it ij}.
This suggests that in the case of $\phi_H=10^\circ$ we have been discussing so far, $M_{23} < M_{12}$, which is confirmed by our simulations.
Indeed, when $H<H^*$ as the field decreases, this leads to $E_{23} < E_{12}$ causing the system to move from state 2 to state 3.

\subsection{Magnetic Configuration}

\end{figure}
Now that we have a firm grasp of the energetics of the problem, we turn to an investigation of the behavior of the spins that results from it.
Again, we focus first on the most interesting situation of the magic angle regime at $\phi_H=10^\circ$.
The magnetic configurations for the four states that are sequentially visited are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_4configs}.
In the low-field states 1 and 3, Mn spins align closely with the anisotropy axes of the two chains.
The Gd spins (green) align in general largely antiferromagnetically with the closest Mn ion (purple) of the chain that they are coupled strongest to ($v_1$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_unit_cell}(a)).
This causes a roughly left left right right sequence of the Gd spins along the $a$-axis at low field. 

In the high-field states 2 and 4, Mn spins are nearly orthogonal to the magnetic field, in order to maximize the gain on Zeeman energy (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:GdMn2O5_Zeeman}).
The Gd spins in this case are again influenced mostly by the antiferromagnetic exchange with the nearest Mn ion, but they are tilted towards the field due to the Zeeman interaction.
The higher the strength of the applied field, the more do the Gd spins tilt towards it.
\\\\
As could already be deduced from our earlier discussion on the trajectory through the ($\phi_{L_1}$, $\phi_{L_2}$) energy surfaces (Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap}), we can observe that the spins associated with $\bm L_1$ perform a unidirectional rotation during the up--down field sweeps.
The Gd spins that are coupled strongest to this chain through $v_1$ perform a similar rotational motion, but with less well-defined increments.
% The spins of the other chain, $\bm L_2$ seem to only toggle between two states, and a similar behavior can be observed for the Gd spins coupled most strongly to it.
Indeed, focusing on the highlighted spins in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_4configs}, we see that the chains rotate with increments of around to 90$^\circ$ between the states, performing a full 360$^\circ$ rotation by the time they arrive back at the original configuration.
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
This peculiar ``crankshaft'' like behavior is a direct result of the evolution of the energy minima and barriers as discussed in the previous chapter.
We use this crankshaft analogy because the material seemingly converts the linear up--down motion of the magnetic field (the ``piston'') into the circular motion performed by the spins (the ``driveshaft'').
\\\\
This brings us to the final remark we wish to make on the motion of the spins.
By applying the field at a negative magic angle $\phi_H = -10^\circ$, we find that $\bm L_2$ now performs the full cycle rotation, along with the Gd spins that it strongest couples to, leading to the same four-state switching loop as for $\phi_H = 10^\circ$ (compare panels (a,b) in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment2}).
This behavior follows from another symmetry operation that is present in the system: the $\tilde{2}_x$ crystal symmetry combined with a translation by $a$, $S_a$, under which $(L_1^x,L_1^y) \rightarrow (L_2^x,-L_2^y)$.
In this case, horizontal valleys appear in the potential energy landscape instead of the vertical ones in Figs.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(d-f) and ~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap}.
Accordingly, $\bm{L}_2$ at this negative magic angle rotates in the opposite direction compared to  $\bm{L}_1$ at $\phi_{\rm H} = +10^\circ$.
The rotation direction is unchanged under the magnetic field reversal ($\bm{L}_{1,2}$ is invariant under $T$ combined with $S_a$, whereas $\bm{H}$ changes sign), and under the combined reversal of $\bm{L}_{1}$ and $\bm{L}_{2}$.
The left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_regimes} summarizes all the switching regimes found in GdMn$_2$O$_5$.
\\\\
%
Since the ferroelectric polarization $P_b$ is a direct result of the magnetic configuration, we briefly comment on how these different switching behaviors for the spin are translated in to the plots of the polarization in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory} and Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}.
Most of the evolution of $P_b$ can be understood from the $\bm L_1 \cdot \bm L_2$ part. The contribution due to the Gd--Mn exchange striction behaves similarly due to strong coupling $v_1$, with an additional superposed contribution due to the slight rotations that the Gd perform away from the switching fields.
At $\phi_{\rm H} = \pm 20^\circ$, both N\'eel vectors $\bm L$ toggle between two directions in such a way that the angle between them and, hence, the electric polarization changes very little (Figs.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_regimes}(b,f),~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}(c), and~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(c)). 
On the other hand, at $\phi_{H}=0^\circ$, $\bm{L}_1$ and  $\bm{L}_2$ tilt in opposite directions. The resulting large variation of the angle between these two vectors gives rise to the two-state switching with the polarization reversal, as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_regimes}(d),~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_experiment1}(a), and ~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(a). This suggests that small-amplitude relative rotation of $\bm{L}_1$ and $\bm{L}_2$ is an electromagnon mode that could be excited by oscillating $H_a$ or $E_b$.
On the boundary between the two extremes one of the $\bm L$ toggles while the other performs the full 360$^\circ$ rotation, leading to the four-state polarization loops.
%

\subsection{Topology \label{sec:GdMn2O5_topology}}
We have hinted a couple of times during this Chapter at the fact that the switching behavior carries some notion of topology with it.
We will sharpen our previous statements in this section and comment on the generality and robustness of the observed behavior.
\\\\
Comparing the trajectories (white lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(d-f) and Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap}) that describe the field evolution of the state, we see that it is confined to one of the vertical valleys, as discussed previously.
This is true for all regimes. When $\phi_H = +10^\circ$, $\phi_{L_1}$ varies strongest, whereas for $\phi_H = -10^\circ$, $\phi_{L_2}$ varies the most.
The system remains inside the valley that hosts the original state in both cases.

In the two-state regimes (Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(d,f)), the system remains in the neighbourhood of the starting point, with the trajectory contractible to a single point. 
In the four-state regime in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(e), as we have seen, the system progresses through the entire valley in a unidirectional sense, connecting the top and bottom edges, with $\bm{L}_1$ rotating a full $360^\circ$.

In this case, the path can not be fully contracted in the same way which highlights its {\em  topologically distinct} nature compared to the other two regimes.
Indeed, we can associate a winding number $Q$ to such trajectories in the two-dimensional $(\phi_{\rm L1},\phi_{\rm L2})$ space defined as:
\begin{equation}
Q=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{t_0} dt (L_1^x\partial_t L_1^y - L_1^y \partial_t L_1^x) + (L_2^y\partial_t L_2^x - L_2^x \partial_t L_2^y),
\end{equation}
where the integral is taken over the time interval, $t_0$, during which the magnetic field is ramped up and down twice and the system is returned to its initial state.
In the two state switching regimes, $Q  = 0$, whereas for the four state switching, $Q = 1$.
This means that as long as the low and high angle regimes are present in a material (Fig~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory} (d,f)), there will always exist a boundary region near the magic angle (Fig~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(e)), interpolating between the two, and leading to the circular four state hysteresis.
\\\\
We finish this section by demonstrating the generality of this behavior, owing to its topological nature.

The size and position of the four state regime depends on the details of the used parameters, but similar to other topological boundaries (e.g. magnetic domain walls, topologically protected edge states in topological insulators), it can not be destroyed when the neighboring ``domains'' are present (high and low angle switching regimes).
The influence of varying a single model parameter is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_windingvsparam}, where the blue and red regions correspond to the angles where the low and high angle regimes appear, respectively.
Indeed, we see that for many parameters the four state region exists as the boundary between those of the two state regimes.
One can also observe that the influence of some parameters is higher than others. For instance, taking $v_1=0.7$ meV dramatically increases the width of the four state switching region to the interval for $\phi_H$ of [5.2$^\circ$, 17.6$^\circ$].
However, even at very high values of $v_1$ does the four state switching appear.
A small variation to $K_L$, the strength of the Mn single-ion anisotropy, on the other hand, leads to a big change to the characteristics of the topologically protected region.
This is not surprising, since the behavior of the Mn chains is very similar to that of the usual spin-flop transition, which crucially depends on the easy-axis anisotropy. This latter point will be discussed further in the next Section.

	\caption{\label{fig:GdMn2O5_windingvsparam} {\bf Magic Angle region.} The panels demonstrate the influence of selected model parameters on the magic angle region. In each panel only the parameter labeled on the vertical axis is varied, whereas the others are kept at the values reported in the Methods Section \ref{sec:GdMn2O5_methods}, and used for Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}. All parameters are reported in units of meV. The blue regions denote the angles $\phi_H$ for which the low angle switching regime appears, while the red denotes the same for the high angle switching regime. The white boundary region is where the magic angle switching regime occurs, characterized by a winding number of 1, and is topologically protected by the neighboring regimes.}
\end{figure}
\\\\
We have so far given a detailed description of the observed behavior, experimentally and from the simulations of our effective model.
While the model reproduces the experiments remarkably well, and we have found that a combination of symmetries and energeticslies at the core of the peculiar switching behavior, one may wonder if this can be rationalized further.
In attempt to do just this, we proceed in the following section with some intuitive considerations of the behavior.

\subsection{Intuition}
First of all, we would like to point out the similarity of the behavior of $\bm L_1$ and $\bm L_2$ with the well-known spin-flop transition in antiferromagnets.
As mentioned before around Eq.~\eqref{eq:GdMn2O5_Zeeman}, when a magnetic field is applied along the easy-axis of an antiferromagnetic material, the antiferromagnetic order will flip perpendicular to it when the field grows.
This occurs when the Zeeman energy that can be gained through canting (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:GdMn2O5_Zeeman}) outweighs the penalty incurred from the misalignment with the easy axis.

The sudden flip is a result of a similar flattening of the energy potential as what happens in our case at the switching field. A visual representation of this flattening can be found in the energy surface displayed in the panel for a field magnitude $|H| = 4.33$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_heatmap}, where the valley has an almost uniform purple color.
In such flat potentials, a small imbalance to one direction can lead to a big movement of the order parameter, which is exactly what leads to the sudden reorientation of the spins in a spin-flop transitions.
In our case, a clear signature of these sudden variations is found in the jumps of $P_b$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_theory}(a-c) around the aforementioned field of $\sim$ 4 T.
The remarkable difference of the behavior described here, compared to the vanilla spin-flop transition, is that a well defined-flop direction is preferred. In spin-flops it makes no difference whether the system flops by $+90^\circ$ or $-90^\circ$. Here it does, and the ``flop direction'' of $\bm L_1$ or $\bm L_2$ is always the same.
\\\\
While further microscopic studies are needed to completely unravel the reason behind this, we suggest that this coaxing of the $\bm L$ is due to the exchange interaction with the Gd spins. We attempt to describe the idea by following the evolution of the two highlighted spins in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_4configs}.

Due to the strong interaction of the long Gd spin (S=7/2) with the magnetic field, it orients towards the field when it is ramped up, while the chain $\bm L_1$ remains relatively strongly pinned because of its high anisotropy.
Since the field is applied at an angle smaller than the $23.4^\circ$ angle of the $\bm L_1$ easy axis, the force applied by the Gd spin pushes the chain towards one of the two flop directions.

When the chain then eventually flops with an 90$^\circ$ increment, the Gd spin reorients as to optimize the exchange with the chain.
This leads to an aligment of the Gd spin that was originally a at positive relative angle w.r.t. the field ($\phi_{Gd}>10^\circ$), to now be along a negative relative angle ($\phi_{Gd}<10^\circ$).
When the field then decreases, the Gd rotates further in the same direction, towards negative angles, thus pulling the Mn chains towards one of the flop directions, leading to another 90$^\circ$ rotation (this time to align again with the easy axis anistropy).

We hope that this intuitive picture shines some light on what might be happening microscopically to cause the behavior, although we concede the claim that this is a complete microscopic explanation.

\section{Simplified Model}
Having modeled the topologically protected switching in  GdMn$_2$O$_5$ with all its complexity, one may wonder what the minimal requirements are to have a similar behavior where the spins rotate 360$^\circ$ while the applied field only oscillates along a single axis.
It is clear from the spin configurations in Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_spin_configs} that the chain with Mn moments most parallel to the applied field does the full rotation, while the other chain merely toggles around its starting position. As mentioned before, the Gd spins mostly follow the behavior of the chain they are most strongly coupled to. This warrants an attempt to explain the observed behavior using only a single Mn chain with Gd spins, coupled to it via $v_1$. 
In the particular case where the magic angle is along $\phi_H = +10^\circ$, we choose $L_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$, $
S_6$ and $S_7$ as the remaining variables in the model. We also neglect the easy axis anisotropy of Gd spins.
This leaves us with the following Hamiltonian, combining two parts, one with the dipolar terms $H_{dip}$ and another with all the other terms, $H'$:
\begin{align}
	H &= H' + H_{dip} \\
	H' &= v_1(\bm{S}_2 + \bm{S}_3 - (\bm{S}_6 + \bm{S}_7))\cdot\bm{L}_1 \nonumber\\
	&- g \mu_B (\bm{S}_2 + \bm{S}_3 + \bm{S}_6 + \bm{S}_7) \cdot \bm{H} \nonumber\\
	&+ K_L (\bm{L}_1 \cdot \bm{n})^2 \nonumber\\
	H_{dip} &= \frac{1}{2}(g \mu_B)^2\sum_{i\neq j}\left(\frac{\bm{S}_i\cdot \bm{S}_j}{r_{ij}^
3}-3\frac{(\bm{S}_i\cdot \bm{r}_{ij})(\bm{S}_j\cdot \bm{r}_{ij})}{r_{ij}^5}\right)\nonumber.
\end{align}
Due to the symmetries of this simplified model and the geometry of the material we end up with two copies of one spin in the first half of the magnetic unit cell and one in the second half of the unit cell, with the chain in between (see Fig.~\ref{fig:GdMn2O5_simple_model}).
This necessitates $S_2 = S_3$ and $S_6 = S_7$, and thus allows us to consider one of the two copies. Again, we keep only nearest-neighbor magnetodipolar terms, and arrive to
\begin{align}
	H' &= 2v_1(\bm{S}_3 - \bm{S}_6)\cdot\bm{L}_1 - 2g \mu_B (\bm{S}_3 + \bm{S}_6) 
\cdot \bm{H} \\
	&+ K_L (\bm{L}_1 \cdot \bm{n})^2 \nonumber\\
	H_{dip} &= (g \mu_B)^2\left(\frac{\bm{S}_3\cdot \bm{S}_6}{r_{36}^3}-3\frac{(\bm{S}_3\cdot \bm{r}_{36})(\bm{S}_6\cdot \bm{r}_{36})}{r_{36}^5}\right)\nonumber,
\end{align}
as a minimal model that still demonstrates the crankshaft-like behavior.

\section{Conclusions}
We used a relatively general and simple, quasi-classical spin model in order to describe a never before observed four-state switching loop in GdMn$_2$O$_5$.
The model reproduces the experimental measurements well, and from further analysis it leads to the conclusion that this behavior is topologically protected by the presence of two, more normal, two-state magnetoelectric switching regimes.
While we deviced a set of model parameters to reproduce the behavior in GdMn$_2$O$_5$, it turns out that a wide set of model parameters can generate the same behavior.
Furthermore, due to the topological nature of the effect, we posit that the screening for further materials exhibiting a similar behavior would be relatively simple since only high and low angle regimes need to be identified.
The magic angle boundary region will then necessarily exist at an intermediate angle.

We also found that the novel four-state regime comes together with a unique large-amplitude collective mode -- the full-circle rotation of half the spins.
The robust unidrectional spin rotation originates from the asymmetric evolution of the energy landscape, and corresponds to an incontractible loop in the order parameter space, ultimately leading to the topological nature of the switching in this material.
This is a microscopic analogue to the crankshaft in a car, transforming linear back-and-forth motion of the applied magnetic field (the piston) into circular motion of the spins (crankshaft).
Due to different behavior of the two chains in GdMn$_2$O$_5$, i.e. one doing a full-circle rotation while the other toggles, the double sweep of the magnetic field is accompanied by two reversals of the electric polarization.
%
Combined with the coupling of this soft magnetic mode to the electric polarization, a degree of electric control over the magnetic configuration may be possible~\cite{Oh14}.
One could envision a theoretical application of this behavior as an electric counter of magnetic field pulses.
