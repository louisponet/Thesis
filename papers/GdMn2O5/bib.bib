  Abstract                 = {The evolution of the magnetic propagation vector of the magnetically ordered phases of TbMn2O5 has been studied as a function of magnetic field applied parallel to both [010] and [100] axes. The results have been used to construct (H, T) phase diagrams showing the regions of stability of the three distinct phases IC1, C, and IC2 known to exist in zero field. Application of magnetic field along [010] increases the stability range of the commensurate C phase at the expense of the two incommensurate phases IC1 and IC2, whereas applying the field along [100] has the opposite effect. The evolution with field of the magnetic structure of the C phase has been determined from the integrated intensities of sets of magnetic reflections measured with different field values. With the field along [010], there are no significant changes in structure in fields up to 6â€‰T. Applying the field parallel to [100] leads to an apparently continuous increase in the z component of the propagation vector from 0.25 in zero field to â‰ˆ0.3 in 6â€‰T. This change is accompanied by increasing ferromagnetic polarisation of the Tb sublattices. Polarised neutron measurements made on the fundamental reflections show that there is no significant ferromagnetic polarisation of any the Mn sublattices in fields of up to 6â€‰T.},

  Abstract                 = {Magnetic ordering around the ferroelectric transition temperature T C1 of weakly ferroelectric YMn 2 O 5 has been reinvestigated by single-crystal neutron diffraction and dielectric measurements. Besides a two-dimensionally modulated incommensurate magnetic (2D-ICM) phase with the propagation vector q = ( q x ,0, q z ) and a lock-in commensurate magnetic (CM) one with q = (1/2,0,1/4) reported previously, we observed a 1D-ICM phase characterized by q = ( q x ,0,1/4) with q x 0.492 that appears in a narrow temperature interval of 1 K and separates the 2D-ICM and CM phases. Corresponding to the 2D-ICM-to-1D-ICM and 1D-ICM-to-CM phase transitions at T = 40.8 K and 40.0 K, a sharp peak and a shoulder in the dielectric constant along the b -axis were detected. These results suggest that the ferroelectricity appears simultaneously with the magnetic phase transition from the 2D-ICM to 1D-ICM phase in YMn 2 O 5 .},

  Abstract                 = {Magnetic transitions from the paramagnetic state to an incommensurate magnetic structure and then to an ordered phase with long-range antiferromagnetic order in RMn 2 O 5 (R is a rare-earth ion) oxides are analyzed. It is shown that a transition from the paramagnetic to the incommensurate phase is associated with exchange as well as relativistic interactions and can be described, apart from the basic magnetic order parameter, by an associated order parameter (viz., electric polarization along the y axis of the crystal). As a result of such a transition, the emergence of electric polarization in the crystal is not accompanied by a change in crystal symmetry.},

  Abstract                 = {The long-range magnetic ordering of PrMn 2 O 5 has been studied on polycrystalline samples from neutron diffraction and specific heat measurements. The onset of antiferromagnetic ordering is observed at T . In the temperature interval the magnetic structure is defined by the propagation vector k 1. Below 18Â K, some additional magnetic satellites appear in the NPD patterns, which are indexed with k =Â (0,0,1/2). Therefore, below 18Â K the magnetic structure consists of two independent magnetic domains, defined by the propagation vectors k 1 and k 2 . The magnetic structure of the k 1 -domain is given by the basis vectors ( C x ,0,0) and ( C x ?,0,0) for Mn(4h) and Mn(4f), respectively. In the k 2 -domain, the magnetic structure is defined by the basis vectors (0,0, G z ) and ( F x ?, G y ?,0) for Mn(4h) and Mn(4f), respectively. At T , for the magnetic phase associated with k 1 , the magnetic moments of the Mn atoms at the 4h and 4f sites are 1.82(7) and 1.81(6) ? B , respectively; for the magnetic phase associated with k 2 , the magnetic moments for the Mn(4h) and Mn(4f) atoms are 0.59(5) and 2.62(5) ? B , respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The high pressure behavior of multiferroic BiMn 2 O 5 has been investigated using powder x-ray diffraction and Raman scattering techniques as well as density functional theory based first principles calculations. Our investigations show a reversible iso-structural phase transition in BiMn 2 O 5 above 10Â GPa. The compressibility along the c axis, i.e.Â along the edge-shared distorted Mn 4+ octahedral chains, has been found to be significantly reduced above this phase transition, suggesting a dominant role of the relatively rigid Mnâ€“O framework in the high pressure phase rather than that of the coordination sphere around the Bi atom. Bader charge analysis of the charge densities obtained from first principles calculations shows partial atomic charge redistribution among Bi 3+ and Mn 3+ atoms across the phase transition which could be the probable cause of this phase transition.},

It is shown that phase separation and charge carrier self-organization in the crystals give rise to a layered superstructure perpendicular to the c axis. An effect of magnetic field cycling on the superstructure, magnetization, and magnetoresistance is demonstrated. X-ray diffraction studies of ECMO demonstrating the effect of magnetic field on the superstructure are presented. The deÂ Haas-vanÂ Alphen magnetization oscillations in high magnetic fields and the temperature-induced magnetic oscillations in a fixed magnetic field are observed at low temperatures. Below 10Â K the quantum corrections to magnetization due to the weak charge carrier localization in 2D superlattice layers occur. It is shown that at all the temperatures the Eu 1? x Ce x Mn 2 O 5 magnetic state is dictated by superparamagnetism of isolated ferromagnetic domains.},

abstract = {Polarization, dielectric permittivity, and low-frequency magnetic dynamics (30 – 50 GHz) of GdMn 2 O 5 are presented. The emergence of an abnormally high polarization along the b axis reported recently by N. Lee et al. is verified. It is found that this polarization is rigid and is observed in the internal field. Superlattices formed due to phase separation and charge carrier self-organization in the bulk of GdMn 2 O 5 the single crystals are revealed. The superlattices manifest themselves in the form of a set of ferromagnetic resonances which are responses of individual superlattice layers. A weak polarization along the c axis at T ≤ 130 K caused by the superlattices is observed. The superlattices that occupy a small crystal volume are likely to be domain walls of the rigid bulk multiferroic domains. The correlation between magnetic structure, magnetic dynamics, and polarization in GdMn 2 O 5 is analyzed.},

@article{Zheng2019,
abstract = {Magnetically induced ferroelectric polarization in rare-earth RMn2O5 manganites is believed to originate from the symmetric exchange striction associated with a specific antiferromagnetic phase in the low temperature (T) region and would be irrelevant with electropoling in the high-T paramagnetic-paraelectric phase region. In this work, we demonstrate that low-T pyroelectric polarization of GdMn2O5 single crystals along the b axis in the antiferromagnetic phase exhibits remarkable dependence on the electropoling history imposed in the high-T paramagnetic-paraelectric phase. In particular, the high-T electropoling results in a reversal of ferroelectric polarization in the low-T region, which can be flopped back by the electropoling being sustained in the low-T ferroelectric region. The existence of an electrically polarizable magnetic cluster state in the high-T paramagnetic-paraelectric region is proposed based on a combination of experimental observations and first-principles calculations. An intrinsic correlation between the low-T antiferromagnetic ordering and the high-T polarizable state is discussed. The present experiments unveil the emergent phenomena on multiferroicity of RMn2O5 and suggest an alternative scenario for electrocontrol of magnetism.},

Neutron diffraction shows that Co2+ and Mn4+ ions alternating along the chains exhibit an up-up-down-down († †) magnetic order. The ferroelectricity results from the inversion symmetry breaking in the († †) spin chain with an alternating charge order. Unlike in spiral magnetoelectrics where antisymmetric exchange coupling is active, the symmetry breaking in Ca3(Co,Mn)2O6 occurs through exchange striction associated with symmetric superexchange. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},
