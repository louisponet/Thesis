abstract = {Polarization, dielectric permittivity, and low-frequency magnetic dynamics (30 – 50 GHz) of GdMn 2 O 5 are presented. The emergence of an abnormally high polarization along the b axis reported recently by N. Lee et al. is verified. It is found that this polarization is rigid and is observed in the internal field. Superlattices formed due to phase separation and charge carrier self-organization in the bulk of GdMn 2 O 5 the single crystals are revealed. The superlattices manifest themselves in the form of a set of ferromagnetic resonances which are responses of individual superlattice layers. A weak polarization along the c axis at T ≤ 130 K caused by the superlattices is observed. The superlattices that occupy a small crystal volume are likely to be domain walls of the rigid bulk multiferroic domains. The correlation between magnetic structure, magnetic dynamics, and polarization in GdMn 2 O 5 is analyzed.},

@article{Zheng2019,
abstract = {Magnetically induced ferroelectric polarization in rare-earth RMn2O5 manganites is believed to originate from the symmetric exchange striction associated with a specific antiferromagnetic phase in the low temperature (T) region and would be irrelevant with electropoling in the high-T paramagnetic-paraelectric phase region. In this work, we demonstrate that low-T pyroelectric polarization of GdMn2O5 single crystals along the b axis in the antiferromagnetic phase exhibits remarkable dependence on the electropoling history imposed in the high-T paramagnetic-paraelectric phase. In particular, the high-T electropoling results in a reversal of ferroelectric polarization in the low-T region, which can be flopped back by the electropoling being sustained in the low-T ferroelectric region. The existence of an electrically polarizable magnetic cluster state in the high-T paramagnetic-paraelectric region is proposed based on a combination of experimental observations and first-principles calculations. An intrinsic correlation between the low-T antiferromagnetic ordering and the high-T polarizable state is discussed. The present experiments unveil the emergent phenomena on multiferroicity of RMn2O5 and suggest an alternative scenario for electrocontrol of magnetism.},

@article{Wang2009,
abstract = {Multiferroics, defined for those multifunctional materials in which two or more kinds of fundamental ferroicities coexist, have become one of the hottest topics of condensed matter physics and materials science in recent years. The coexistence of several order parameters in multiferroics brings out novel physical phenomena and offers possibilities for new device functions. The revival of research activities on multiferroics is evidenced by some novel discoveries and concepts, both experimentally and theoretically. In this review article, we outline some of the progressive milestones in this stimulating field, specially for those single phase multiferroics where magnetism and ferroelectricity coexist. Firstly, we will highlight the physical concepts of multiferroicity and the current challenges to integrate the magnetism and ferroelectricity into a single-phase system. Subsequently, we will summarize various strategies used to combine the two types of orders. Special attentions to three novel mechanisms for multiferroicity generation: (1) the ferroelectricity induced by the spin orders such as spiral and E-phase antiferromagnetic spin orders, which break the spatial inversion symmetry, (2) the ferroelectricity originating from the charge ordered states, and (3) the ferrotoroidic system, will be paid. Then, we will address the elementary excitations such as electromagnons, and application potentials of multiferroics. Finally, open questions and opportunities will be prospected.},

@article{Alonso97,
abstract = {The title compounds (R = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, Ho, Er) have been prepared in polycrystalline form by a citrate technique and, excepting the Sm and Eu phases, structurally studied by high-resolution neutron powder diffraction. All the materials are isostructural (space group Pbam, Z = 4) and contain infinite chains of Mn4+O6 octahedra sharing edges, linked together by Mn3+O5 and RO8 units. The size of the three kinds of coordination polyhedron regularly decreases as R cations become smaller. A bond-valence study allowed us to detect the presence of important tensile and compressive stresses in the crystal structure of LaMn2O5, which are progressively released along the series as the rare-earth size decreases. The magnetic properties strongly depend on the nature of R, going from the spin-glass behaviour observed at low temperature in LaMn2O5 to the field-induced transitions exhibited by NdMn2O5. A cusp in the susceptibility curves suggests an antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures, which is masked in the compounds containing strongly paramagnetic rare earths (Tb, Ho, Er). At high temperatures the paramagnetic moments are consistent in all cases with the presence of high-spin Mn3+ and Mn4+ cations.},

@article{Oh2014,
abstract = {The manipulation of magnetic ordering with applied electric fields is of pressing interest for new magnetoelectric devices and information storage applications. Recently, such magnetoelectric control was realized in multiferroics. However, their magnetoelectric switching is often accompanied by significant hysteresis, resulting from a large barrier, separating different ferroic states. Hysteresis prevents robust switching, unless the applied field overcomes a certain value (coercive field). Here we address the role of a switching barrier on magnetoelectric control, and identify a material, collinear antiferromagnetic and pyroelectric Ni3TeO6, in which magnetoelectric switching occurs without hysteresis. The barrier between two magnetic states in the vicinity of a spin-flop transition is almost flat, and thus small changes in external electric/magnetic fields allow to switch the ferroic state through an intermediate state in a continuous manner, resulting in a colossal magnetoelectric response. This colossal magnetoelectric effect resembles the large piezoelectric effect at the morphotropic phase boundary in ferroelectrics.},
