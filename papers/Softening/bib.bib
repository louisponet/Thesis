abstract = {A number of experimental and computational studies of materials have shown that transport rates in domain walls may significantly differ from those in the bulk. One possible explanation for enhanced transport in a domain wall is that the domain wall is elastically soft with respect to the bulk. We investigate the softening of a ferroelastic domain wall in a simple, generic model. We calculate saddle point energies of solute atoms in the bulk and domain wall, using a geometry such that variation in the saddle point energy cannot be attributed to the structural differences of the bulk and the wall, but must instead be attributed to softening of the wall. Our results show a reduction of the saddle point energy in the wall, thus indicating that, in this model at least, domain walls are elastically soft compared with the bulk. A simple analysis based on an Einstein model allows us to explain the observed softening of the wall.},

In practice, this means that turning a piezoelectric crystal upside down or switching the polarization of a ferroelectric should not change its mechanical response. Strain gradients, however, introduce an additional source of asymmetry that has mechanical consequences. Using nanoindentation and contact-resonance force microscopy, this study demonstrates that the mechanical response to indentation of a uniaxial ferroelectric (LiNbO3) does change when its polarity is switched, and use this mechanical asymmetry both to quantify its flexoelectricity and to mechanically read the sign of its ferroelectric domains.},

The discovery of crack propagation asymmetry proves that fracture physics cannot be assumed to be symmetric in polar materials, and indicates that flexoelectricity should be incorporated in any realistic model.},

abstract = {Cracks generate the largest strain gradients that any material can withstand. Flexoelectricity (coupling between strain gradient and polarization) must therefore play an important role in fracture physics. Here we use a self-consistent continuum model to evidence two consequences of flexoelectricity in fracture: the resistance to fracture increases as structural size decreases, and it becomes asymmetric with respect to the sign of polarization. The latter phenomenon manifests itself in a range of intermediate sizes where piezo- and flexoelectricity compete. In BaTiO3 at room temperature, this range spans from 0.1 to 50 nm, a typical thickness range for epitaxial ferroelectric thin films.},

abstract = {In our earlier studies the BaTiO3 samples were processed at higher temperatures like 1000oC and explained the observed magnetism in it. It is found that the charge transfer effects are playing crucial role in explaining the observed ferromagnetism in it. In the present work the samples were processed at lower temperatures like 650oC-800oC. The carrier densities in these particles were estimated to be ∼ 1019-1020/cm3 range. The band gap is in the range of 2.53eV to 3.2eV. It is observed that magnetization increased with band gap narrowing. The higher band gap narrowed particles exhibited increased magnetization with a higher carrier density of 1.23×1020/cm3 near to the Mott critical density. This hint the exchange interactions between the carriers play a dominant role in deciding the magnetic properties of these particles. The increase in charge carrier density in this undoped BaTiO3 is because of oxygen defects only. The oxygen vacancy will introduce electrons in the system and hence more charge carriers means more oxygen defects in the system and increases the exchange interactions between Ti3+, Ti4+, hence high magnetic moment. The coercivity is increased from 23 nm to 31 nm and then decreased again for higher particle size of 54 nm. These particles do not show photoluminescence property and hence it hints the absence of uniformly distributed distorted [TiO5]-[TiO6] clusters formation and charge transfer between them. Whereas these charge transfer effects are vital in explaining the observed magnetism in high temperature processed samples. Thus the variation of magnetic properties like magnetization, coercivity with band gap narrowing, particle size and charge carrier density reveals the super paramagnetic nature of BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The nonlinear optical coefficients extracted from Z-scan studies suggest that these are potential candidates for optical imaging and signal processing applications.},

This effect is observed in different ferroelectric materials (LiNbO3, BaTiO3, and PbTiO3) and with different morphologies (from single crystals to thin films), suggesting that the effect is universal. We propose a theoretical framework that explains the domain wall softening and justifies that the effect should be common to all ferroelectrics. The lesson is, therefore, that domain walls are not only functionally different from the domains they separate, but also mechanically distinct.},

@article{Harnagea2001,
abstract = {Voltage modulated scanning force microscopy in contact mode or piezoresponse scanning force microscopy is now turning into an established technique for imaging ferroelectric domains in ferroelectric thin films. The quantities measured, however, are the amplitude and phase of a locally induced piezoelectric strain, and not the ferroelectric polarization itself. As all ferroelectrics possess piezoelectric properties, the domain structure visualized does correspond to that of the ferroelectric domains whose polarization is partly normal to the film surface, but the amplitude of the signal is actually not proportional to the magnitude of the normal component of the polarization. Likewise, the shear mode of scanning force microscopy allows the imaging of domains with a polarization component in the plane of the film. Methods to relate the amplitude of the piezoresponse signal to the magnitude of the ferroelectric polarization taking into account the anisotropic nature of the piezoelectric coefficients are described and discussed for the most common ferroelectric materials. {\textcopyright} 2001 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

@article{Tsuji2005,
abstract = {Two-dimensional resonance frequency mapping in the ultrasonic atomic force microscopy was applied to the investigation of the ferroelectric domain structure in lead zirconate titanate ceramics. This method can visualize the stiffness anisotropy due to the differently oriented domains. Moreover, the significant stiffness reduction at the ferroelectric domain boundary was discovered. The disorder of the lattice, the ability of the switching of the domain, and the reduction of the piezoelectric stiffening are possible explanations. The implication of this work is the characterization of novel functional materials on nanoscale and the nondestructive evaluation of the microelectromechanical systems and nanotechnology devices. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Xiao2005,
abstract = {Commonly used ferroelectric perovskites are also wide-band-gap semiconductors. In such materials, the polarization and the space-charge distribution are intimately coupled, and this Letter studies them simultaneously with no a priori ansatz on either. In particular, we study the structure of domain walls and the depletion layers that form at the metal-ferroelectric interfaces. We find the coupling between polarization and space charges leads to the formation of charge double layers at the 90° domain walls, which, like the depletion layers, are also decorated by defects like oxygen vacancies. In contrast, the 180° domain walls do not interact with the defects or space charges. Implications of these results to domain switching and fatigue in ferroelectric devices are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Chen2020,
abstract = {Ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) are nanoscale topological defects that can be easily tailored to create nanoscale devices. Their excitations, recently discovered to be responsible for GHz DW conductivity, hold promise for faster signal transmission and processing compared to the existing technology. Here we find that DW phonons have unprecedented dispersion going from GHz all the way to THz frequencies, and resulting in a surprisingly broad GHz signature in DW conductivity. Puzzling activation of nominally forbidden DW sliding modes in BiFeO3 is traced back to DW tilting and resulting asymmetry in wall-localized phonons. The obtained phonon spectra and selection rules are used to simulate scanning impedance microscopy, emerging as a powerful probe in nanophononics. The results will guide the experimental discovery of the predicted phonon branches and design of DW-based nanodevices operating in the technologically important frequency range.},

For each case we have computed the position, thickness and creation energy of the domain walls, and an estimate of the barrier height for their motion has been obtained. We find both kinds of domain walls to be very narrow with a similar width of the order of one to two lattice constants. The energy of the 90° domain wall is calculated to be (formula presented) about a factor of 4 lower than the energy of its 180° counterpart, and only a miniscule barrier for its motion is found. As a surprising feature we detected a small offset of 0.15-0.2 eV in the electrostatic potential across the 90° domain wall. {\textcopyright} 2002 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Nabarro1947,
abstract = {The properties of dislocations are calculated by an approximate method due to Peierls. The width of a dislocation is small, displacements comparable with the interatomic distance being confined to a few atoms. The shear stress required to move a dislocation in an otherwise perfect lattice is of the order of a thousandth of the "theoretical" shear strength. The energy and effective mass of a single dislocation increase logarithmically with the size of the specimen. A pair of dislocations of opposite sign in the same glide plane cannot be in stable equilibrium unless they are separated by a distance of the order of 10 000 lattice spacings. If an external shear stress is applied there is a critical separation of the pair of dislocations at which they are in unstable equilibrium. The energy of this unstable state is the activation energy for the formation of a pair of dislocations. It depends on the external shear, and for practical stresses is of the order of 7 electron volts per atomic plane. The size and energy of dislocations in real crystals are unlikely to differ greatly from those calculated: the stress required to move a dislocation and the critical separation of two dislocations may be seriously in error.},
